# [Essay Title]

## [Subtitle or Thematic Hook]

> [Opening epigraph - optional]

**Note on Quotes**: Any quote included in this essay must be verifiable by an external source. Never make up a quote or attribute words without a verifiable citation. Include full citation information (author, source title, publication date, page number if available).

---

## Opening

[Begin with a specific object, place, or fact. Follow the Solnit method: spiral outward into unexpected connections. The opening should ground the reader in something concrete before expanding into larger themes.]

---

## [Section Title]

[Body sections develop the essay's central argument or exploration. Each section should:
- Maintain the balance between specific detail and broader meaning
- Include narrative weighting flags where appropriate
- Allow digression to become argument
- Honor specificity: names, dates, species, rock types]

---

## [Section Title]

[Continue developing the essay's exploration. In the McPhee tradition, don't rush geological or historical time. Let the reader feel the weight of millennia when appropriate.]

---

## [Section Title]

[Build toward the essay's culmination. Seek the counterintuitive—the best essays argue against received wisdom while remaining grounded in evidence.]

---

## Closing

[End with an open door. These essays should leave readers with a new question, not a closed conclusion. The universal emerges from the particular.]

---
