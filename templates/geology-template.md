# [Region Name] - Geological Documentation

## Overview

[2-3 paragraphs introducing the geological character of the region, its significance, and what makes it geologically interesting. Lead with the most compelling geological story. Include `[UNEXPECTED]` or `[UNUSUAL]` facts that hook the reader.]

[Paragraph 2: Describe the fundamental geological context—batholith, volcanic province, sedimentary basin, etc. Explain what processes shaped the landscape and over what timescales.]

[Paragraph 3: Preview key themes—glaciation, tectonic activity, unique formations. Mention the "deep time vs. recent sculpting" contrast if applicable.]

## Narrative Highlights

| Flag | Geological Story |
|------|------------------|
| `[PARADOX]` | [Counter-intuitive geological fact—e.g., "domes form from expansion, not compression"] |
| `[UNEXPECTED]` | [Surprising age contrast or geological fact—e.g., "rock is 100 million years old; landscape is 2 million years old"] |
| `[UNUSUAL]` | [Superlative or unique feature—"largest exposed granite monolith on Earth"] |
| `[TURNING]` | [Event that shaped landscape or proved theory—earthquake, glaciation, discovery] |
| `[HUMAN]` | [Scientist's contribution or discovery story—debates, breakthroughs] |
