## Length Guidelines

This template is designed for era-specific documents within the evolutionary history section:

| Document Type | Target Length |
|---------------|---------------|
| Main era document (e.g., Cenozoic) | 300-350 lines |
| Sub-period document (e.g., Pleistocene) | 150-200 lines |
| Specialized focus (e.g., Megafauna) | 100-150 lines |

For the complete three-document evolutionary history structure, see `queries/evolutionary-history-query.md`.
