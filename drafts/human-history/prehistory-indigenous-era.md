# Prehistory and Indigenous Era in Taos, New Mexico
## ~12,000 BCE - 1540 CE

## Era Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Era Name** | Prehistory and Indigenous Era |
| **Time Period** | ~12,000 BCE - 1540 CE |
| **Duration** | ~13,500 years |
| **Preceding Era** | None documented (earliest human presence) |
| **Following Era** | Spanish Colonial Period |
| **Defining Characteristic** | Development of sophisticated Pueblo culture; continuous occupation of Taos Pueblo |

For over 12,000 years, human cultures have inhabited the Taos region, adapting to dramatic environmental changes from the end of the Ice Age through the development of one of North America's most sophisticated indigenous civilizations. This era encompasses the arrival of Paleo-Indian hunters following megafauna, the gradual transition to agricultural societies, and the establishment of Taos Pueblo—a community that has maintained continuous occupation for approximately 1,000 years.

The story of this era is one of remarkable adaptation and cultural achievement. Early inhabitants navigated the disappearance of Ice Age megafauna, developed sophisticated agricultural systems adapted to high-elevation, semi-arid conditions, and created architectural and social systems that persist to the present day. Taos Pueblo stands as a testament to this cultural continuity—one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in North America.

This era ended abruptly with Spanish contact in 1540, initiating a new chapter of colonization, disease, and cultural disruption. Yet the foundations established during this long period—agricultural knowledge, architectural techniques, social organization, and spiritual practices—would prove resilient enough to survive centuries of colonial pressure.

## Context

### What Came Before

Before human arrival, the Taos region was shaped by geological and climatic forces. The end of the Pleistocene epoch brought dramatic environmental changes—retreating glaciers, changing vegetation, and the disappearance of megafauna. These changes created both challenges and opportunities for the first human inhabitants.

### Regional Context

The Taos region sits at the intersection of multiple cultural and ecological zones:
- **High desert** environment with limited water resources
- **Mountain ecosystems** providing diverse resources
- **Rio Grande corridor** facilitating trade and migration
- **Cultural crossroads** connecting Pueblo peoples with Plains, Great Basin, and other groups

### Global Context

During this era, human civilizations worldwide were developing agriculture, permanent settlements, and complex social organization. The Ancestral Puebloan development in the American Southwest paralleled similar developments in Mesoamerica, though with distinctive adaptations to the high-desert environment.
