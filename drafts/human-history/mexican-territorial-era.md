# Mexican and Territorial Era in Taos, New Mexico
## 1821 - 1912

## Era Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Era Name** | Mexican and Territorial Era |
| **Time Period** | 1821 - 1912 |
| **Duration** | 91 years |
| **Preceding Era** | Spanish Colonial Period |
| **Following Era** | Modern/Contemporary Era |
| **Defining Characteristic** | Transition from Spanish to Mexican to American control; increasing American settlement; land and water disputes |

The Mexican and Territorial Era in Taos represents a period of transition and transformation—from Spanish colonial control through Mexican independence to American territorial status and eventual statehood. This era saw the region pass through three different colonial regimes in less than a century, each bringing new challenges and opportunities for Pueblo communities, Hispanic settlers, and American newcomers.

This era is marked by increasing American influence, the arrival of figures like Kit Carson, ongoing conflicts over land and water rights, and the paradox of isolation that would later attract artists. Unlike many Western regions, Taos remained without direct railroad access well into the 20th century—an isolation that paradoxically contributed to the region's unique character and appeal.

The era ended with New Mexico statehood in 1912, bringing full representation in the federal government but also new regulations and development pressures. The foundations laid during this period—land disputes, water rights conflicts, and the region's reputation for cultural authenticity—would shape Taos's development for decades to come.
