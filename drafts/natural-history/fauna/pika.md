# American Pika
*Ochotona princeps*

## Biographical Lead Quote

> "The landscape here is unlike anything else. The light, the colors, the forms—everything is different, more intense."
> — **Georgia O'Keeffe**, on New Mexico landscape (1929)

*Note: Pikas exemplify the intense, distinctive character of alpine landscapes—small mammals that survive year-round in harsh conditions above treeline, representing the unique adaptations that define high-elevation ecosystems that drew O'Keeffe to New Mexico.*

## Evolutionary History

### Origin and Evolution
- **Evolutionary Age**: Genus *Ochotona* dates to Miocene (~20 million years ago)
- **Origin Region**: Asia; spread to North America
- **Closest Relatives**: Other lagomorphs; rabbits and hares (distantly related)
- **How It Reached Taos, New Mexico**: Native to region; alpine distribution

### Endemic Status `[UNUSUAL]`

While not endemic, pikas represent important alpine specialists. `[UNUSUAL]` Their restriction to alpine talus slopes and adaptations to harsh conditions make them indicators of alpine ecosystem health. They are considered "Ice Age relicts" that survived in alpine refugia.

### Fossil Record

Fossil evidence indicates pikas have been present in North America for millions of years. `[HUMAN]` Their persistence in alpine refugia through climate changes demonstrates remarkable adaptations to extreme conditions.

### Unique Adaptations `[UNUSUAL]`

Pikas have evolved remarkable adaptations:

- **Alpine specialization** - Survives only in alpine talus slopes `[UNUSUAL]`
- **No hibernation** - Active year-round without hibernating `[UNEXPECTED]`
- **Hay-making** - Cuts and dries vegetation for winter storage `[UNUSUAL]`
- **Cold tolerance** - Survives harsh alpine winters
- **Talus adaptation** - Specialized for life in rocky talus slopes

`[UNEXPECTED]` These adaptations allow pikas to survive year-round in harsh alpine conditions where most mammals hibernate or migrate away, while their hay-making behavior enables winter survival without hibernation.
