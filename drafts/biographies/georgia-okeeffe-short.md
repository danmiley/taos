## Biography Summary

### Early Life

Georgia Totto O'Keeffe was born November 15, 1887, in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, into a farming family. She was the second of seven children, and her family supported her early artistic interests. Her childhood in rural Wisconsin, surrounded by natural landscapes, may have influenced her later attraction to the dramatic landscapes of New Mexico. She received extensive art training, including study at the Art Institute of Chicago, Art Students League in New York, and Teachers College at Columbia University, which gave her technical skills that she would later apply to painting the Southwest's unique landscapes and forms.

### Career/Public Life

O'Keeffe first visited Taos in 1929, drawn by the region's dramatic landscape, distinctive light, and artistic community. Her visit was part of a broader exploration of the Southwest, which would lead to her establishing residence in New Mexico. While she would become more closely associated with Abiquiu and Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico, her visits to Taos contributed to the region's artistic reputation and her own artistic development. Her paintings of Taos landscapes, Pueblo communities, and regional scenes helped establish New Mexico's visual identity and contributed to how Americans saw the Southwest.

### Personal Life

O'Keeffe was characterized by artistic dedication, independence, and deep connection to natural landscapes. Her decision to establish residence in New Mexico and paint the region extensively demonstrates her commitment to finding artistic inspiration in dramatic natural environments. Her independence and determination shaped both her artistic career and her personal life. She maintained her connection to New Mexico, including visits to Taos, until her death in 1986 at age 98.

### Legacy

O'Keeffe's impact on Taos was significant despite her status as a visitor rather than permanent resident. Her paintings of the region, including Taos scenes, contributed to the area's artistic reputation and helped establish New Mexico's visual identity. Her association with the Southwest, including Taos, continues to attract art enthusiasts and cultural tourists. The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe preserves her legacy, and her former residences at Ghost Ranch and Abiquiu are preserved as memorials.
