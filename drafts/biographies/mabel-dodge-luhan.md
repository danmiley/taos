## Overview

Mabel Dodge Luhan stands as one of the most influential cultural figures in Taos's modern history—a wealthy patron who transformed a remote mountain valley into a gathering place for some of the 20th century's most significant artists and writers. `[UNEXPECTED]` Fleeing New York society in 1917, she arrived in Taos seeking "authentic" indigenous culture and remote isolation, yet her very presence helped transform the region into an internationally recognized cultural destination.
