## Biography Summary

### Early Life

Aldo Leopold was born January 11, 1887, in Burlington, Iowa. He developed an early interest in nature and the outdoors. He attended Yale Forest School (now Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies), graduating in 1909. His education prepared him for a career in forestry and conservation.

### Career/Public Life

Leopold joined the U.S. Forest Service in 1909 and was assigned to the Southwest. In 1911, he was transferred to the Carson National Forest in northern New Mexico as deputy supervisor, and in 1912 became supervisor—a position he held until 1913. The Carson National Forest includes the Taos area, making Leopold's work directly relevant to the region. During his tenure, he founded and edited the "Carson Pine Cone," a U.S. Forest Service newsletter that promoted conservation principles.

Leopold's experiences in the Southwest, including the Taos region, deeply influenced his conservation philosophy. He observed the impacts of overgrazing, deforestation, and other environmental pressures on the landscape. These observations led to his advocacy for wilderness preservation and the establishment of the Gila Wilderness Area in 1924—the first designated wilderness area in the United States.

### Connection to Taos, New Mexico

Aldo Leopold's connection to Taos, New Mexico, is direct and significant. As supervisor of the Carson National Forest (1912-1913), which includes the Taos area, Leopold worked in and managed lands that encompassed the region. His work in the Carson National Forest involved:

- Forest management and conservation practices
- Addressing issues of overgrazing and land degradation
- Developing conservation principles that would influence his later work
- Founding and editing the "Carson Pine Cone" newsletter

Leopold's experiences in the Southwest, including his time in the Carson National Forest/Taos area, were formative in developing his conservation philosophy. The landscape, wildlife, and environmental challenges he observed in the region influenced his thinking about wilderness preservation, ecosystem management, and the relationship between humans and nature—ideas that would later be expressed in "A Sand County Almanac" and his work establishing the Gila Wilderness.

### Legacy

Leopold's legacy as the "father of wildlife ecology" and a foundational figure in American conservation is profound. His work in the Carson National Forest/Taos area was instrumental in developing the conservation principles that would guide his career. His establishment of the Gila Wilderness Area in 1924 set a precedent for wilderness preservation that continues to influence conservation policy today. His book "A Sand County Almanac," published posthumously in 1949, remains one of the most influential works in environmental literature.
