# Agent Handoff: Phase 2 - Geological Features Documentation

## Quick Context

**Project**: Taos, New Mexico Regional Concordance  
**Status**: Phase 1 ✅ Complete (10-part extended overview finished)  
**Your Task**: Create 4-8 individual geological feature documents (~200-450 lines each)

---

## What You Need to Do

Create **4-8 standalone geological feature documents** for Taos, New Mexico. Each document tells the story of a specific geological formation (gorge, peak, volcanic field, etc.).

**Target**: 4-8 documents totaling ~800-3,600 lines

---

## Feature Selection

Choose features that are:
- **Narratively compelling** (multiple `[UNEXPECTED]`, `[PARADOX]`, `[UNUSUAL]`, `[HUMAN]` flags)
- **Superlatives or type localities** ("highest," "oldest," "only")
- **Visitor-accessible** (people can see/experience them)
- **Have human connections** (discovery stories, climbing, indigenous knowledge)

**Potential Features** (research and select 4-8):
- Rio Grande Gorge (800-ft deep, invisible from valley floor)
- Wheeler Peak (highest in NM, 13,161 ft)
- Taos Plateau Volcanic Field (massive basalt flows)
- Sangre de Cristo Fault System (active faulting)
- Servilleta Basalt Formation (primary volcanic flow)
- [Research may reveal others]

## Document Requirements

**Template**: Use `templates/geological-feature-template.md`

**Required Sections**:
1. Overview (lead with compelling hook)
2. Quick Facts Table
3. Narrative Highlights Table (flag stories)
4. Deep Time Context (when rock formed, how exposed, ongoing processes)
5. Formation Process (step-by-step)
6. Composition and Structure
7. Geology-Human Connections (discovery, climbing, indigenous knowledge)
8. Scientific Significance
9. Current Status
10. Visitor Information
11. Cross-References

**Length**: 200-450 lines per feature (based on narrative value)

**File Location**: Save in `/drafts/geology/[feature-name].md`

---

## Narrative Weighting

Flag content with:
- `[UNEXPECTED]` - Counter-intuitive facts
- `[PARADOX]` - Apparent contradictions explained
- `[UNUSUAL]` - Superlatives, rarities
- `[HUMAN]` - Discovery stories, human connections
- `[TURNING]` - Events that changed understanding

**Goal**: Make readers say "I never knew that!"

## Research Questions

For each feature, answer:
1. How did it form? (formation process)
2. When did rock form? When exposed? (deep time)
3. What makes it unique? (superlatives, characteristics)
4. Who discovered it? When? Story? `[HUMAN]`
5. Why do geologists study it? (scientific significance)
6. How do humans interact? (climbing, tourism, indigenous knowledge)
7. Current status? (threats, conservation, research)
