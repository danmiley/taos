## Output Structure

Organize findings into:

### Primary Findings (High Narrative Weight)
Content meeting narrative criteria with flags:
- [Fact] `[FLAG]`

### Supporting Context (Essential Background)
Standard factual information:
- [Basic fact with source]

---

## Cross-Reference Checklist

3. **The Unusual** `[UNUSUAL]` — Outliers, anomalies, statistical rarities
4. **Human Interest** `[HUMAN]` — Personal stories and character-revealing details
5. **Turning Points** `[TURNING]` — Moments where outcomes hung in balance

### Output Format
