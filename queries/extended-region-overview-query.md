## How to Use This Template

1. Use each part section as a focused research prompt
2. Apply narrative weighting throughout
3. End each part with a timestamp checkpoint
4. Cross-reference between parts as you build content
5. The result should be ~1000+ lines across 10 files

## Narrative Weighting Instructions

Apply these criteria to prioritize content with high narrative value:

1. **The Unexpected** `[UNEXPECTED]` — Facts that contradict common assumptions
2. **Paradox Resolution** `[PARADOX]` — Details explaining apparent contradictions
3. **The Unusual** `[UNUSUAL]` — Outliers, anomalies, statistical rarities
4. **Human Interest** `[HUMAN]` — Personal stories and character-revealing details
5. **Turning Points** `[TURNING]` — Moments where outcomes hung in balance

### Output Format

**Primary Findings** (high narrative weight):
- [Fact with source] `[CRITERION-FLAG]`

**Supporting Context** (essential background):
- [Background fact with source]

Maintain factual accuracy. Narrative interest guides selection, never overrides truthfulness.

## Quote Attribution Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: When including quotes in extended overview content, follow these strict requirements:

- **Verification Required**: Any attribution of a quote must be verifiable by an external source. Every quote must have a traceable citation to a published work, interview transcript, archival document, or other verifiable source.
- **Never Fabricate**: Never make up a quote, paraphrase it as a quote, or attribute words to someone without a verifiable source. If you cannot verify a quote, do not include it.
- **Full Citation**: Include complete citation information: author name, source title, publication date, and page number (if available).
- **Source Verification**: Before including any quote, verify it exists in the cited source. Cross-reference multiple sources when possible.
- **Unverified Quotes**: If a quote cannot be verified, either omit it entirely or paraphrase the idea with proper attribution to the source.

These guidelines ensure the integrity and credibility of all extended overview content.
