## Example Narrative-Weighted Findings

**High Narrative Weight:**
- "Despite being geographically isolated, the community has the highest percentage of PhD holders per capita in the country—a legacy of the research station established here in 1956." `[UNEXPECTED]`
- "The region operates under a unique 'co-management' agreement where tribal and federal authorities share equal jurisdiction over natural resources." `[UNUSUAL]`
- "When the mine closed in 1983, 60% of the population left within two years. Today, those who stayed have rebuilt around eco-tourism." `[TURNING]` `[HUMAN]`
- "Residents simultaneously identify strongly as [nationality] and as a distinct people apart—a paradox reflected in their push for both autonomy and federal support." `[PARADOX]`

**Supporting Context:**
- "The region has a population of 45,000 according to the 2020 census."
- "The median household income is $52,000."

3. **The Unusual** `[UNUSUAL]` — Unique governance, rare cultural practices
4. **Human Interest** `[HUMAN]` — Community stories, individual experiences
