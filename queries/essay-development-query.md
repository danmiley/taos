## Method: Solnit + McPhee

Essays follow principles drawn from Rebecca Solnit and John McPhee:

### The Solnit Method
Begin with a specific object, place, or fact, then spiral outward into unexpected connections. Allow digression to become argument.

### McPhee's Patience
Don't rush geological or historical time. Let the reader feel the weight of millennia.

### Core Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Seek the counterintuitive** | Argue against received wisdom while remaining grounded in evidence |
| **Honor specificity** | Names, dates, species, rock types. The universal emerges from the particular |
| **End with an open door** | Leave readers with a new question, not a closed conclusion |

## Target Length

**4,000–6,000 words** — the length of a substantial magazine feature.

| Length | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Under 3,000 words | Too compressed; arguments feel rushed |
| **4,000–6,000 words** | Ideal range; room for depth and return |
| Over 7,000 words | Consider splitting into two essays |

## Essay Structure

### Opening
Begin with a specific object, place, or fact. Ground the reader in something concrete before expanding.

### Body Sections (5-10)
- Each section develops part of the argument
- Maintain balance between specific detail and broader meaning
- Apply narrative flags where appropriate
- Allow digressions that become arguments

### Closing
End with an open door. Leave readers with a new question, not a closed conclusion.

### Bibliography
Curated sources for readers who want to explore further:
- Prioritize readable, engaging sources over technical papers
- Include mix of classic works and recent journalism
- Annotate each source briefly for reader guidance
- Include project cross-references

## Human Review Workflow

Essays require human review before publication:

```
Draft → Human Review → Approved? → Promote to docs/ → Next Essay
              ↓
           Revise
```

**CRITICAL**: Do not begin the next essay until the current essay is approved.

---

## Quote Attribution Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: When including quotes in essays, follow these strict requirements:

- **Verification Required**: Any attribution of a quote must be verifiable by an external source. Every quote must have a traceable citation to a published work, interview transcript, archival document, or other verifiable source.
- **Never Fabricate**: Never make up a quote, paraphrase it as a quote, or attribute words to someone without a verifiable source. If you cannot verify a quote, do not include it.
- **Full Citation**: Include complete citation information: author name, source title, publication date, and page number (if available).
- **Source Verification**: Before including any quote, verify it exists in the cited source. Cross-reference multiple sources when possible.
- **Unverified Quotes**: If a quote cannot be verified, either omit it entirely or paraphrase the idea with proper attribution to the source.

These guidelines ensure the integrity and credibility of all essay content.

---

## Review Criteria

- **Accuracy**: Facts verified against sources
- **Quote Attribution**: All quotes verified and properly cited
- **Argument**: Central claim is clear, supported, counterintuitive
- **Tone**: Patient, specific, spiraling (Solnit/McPhee style)
- **Bibliography**: High-quality, accessible, annotated
- **Narrative Weight**: Flags applied appropriately
- **Length**: Within 4,000-6,000 word target
