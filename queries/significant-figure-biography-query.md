|-----------|----------|
| `[UNEXPECTED]` | Surprising facts, counter-narrative details, hidden history |
| `[UNUSUAL]` | Unique achievements, rare circumstances, distinctive traits |
| `[TURNING]` | Pivotal decisions, moments of crisis, life-changing events |
| `[HUMAN]` | Character-revealing anecdotes, personal struggles, emotional stakes |
| `[PARADOX]` | Contradictions in character, conflicting legacies, moral complexity |

---

## Key Questions to Answer

### Character Questions
- What one anecdote best reveals who they really were? `[HUMAN]`
- What would surprise people about them? `[UNEXPECTED]`
- What contradiction defined them? `[PARADOX]`

### Turning Point Questions
- What single decision most defined their life? `[TURNING]`
- What nearly happened differently? `[TURNING]`
- How did they respond to their greatest failure?

### Legacy Questions
- What did they think was their greatest contribution?
- What do others consider their greatest contribution?
- What has been forgotten about them that shouldn't be? `[UNEXPECTED]`

## Example Narrative-Weighted Findings

**High Narrative Weight:**
- "She nearly abandoned the expedition three days before the discovery that would make her famous—only a telegram from her dying mother convinced her to continue." `[TURNING]` `[HUMAN]`
- "Despite his reputation as a ruthless industrialist, his private letters reveal he anonymously funded the very conservation groups that opposed him." `[PARADOX]` `[UNEXPECTED]`
- "He spoke six indigenous languages fluently—a detail omitted from most biographies because he was afraid it would undermine his 'scientific objectivity.'" `[UNEXPECTED]` `[HUMAN]`
- "When she died in 1987, only 12 people attended her funeral. Today, her statue stands in the town square." `[TURNING]` `[HUMAN]`

**Supporting Context:**
- "Born in 1842 in [City], [Country]."
- "Served as director of the [Institution] from 1889 to 1912."

### Purpose

This section ensures:
- Clear documentation of **when** the figure was in the region
- Precise **chronology** of visits, residency, and activities
- Complete listing of **works created or related** to the region (with dates)

### Research Prompts for [REGION-NAME] Record

When researching, specifically ask:
- When did [FIGURE-NAME] first come to [REGION-NAME]? What were the circumstances?
- How long did they stay? Was it continuous or intermittent?
- Where specifically did they live/stay/work within the region?
- What did they create, write, or produce while there or about the region?
- Who else of significance did they meet or interact with in the region?
- What notable events occurred during their time there?
- Are there anecdotes about their regional experiences?

### Cross-Referencing

When documenting encounters:
- Link to other biography documents if the person is also documented
- Note if encounters appear in both biographies (for consistency)
- Include dates where known to enable timeline construction

---

## Multiple Figure Strategy

When documenting 4-8 figures for a region:

1. **Ensure diversity**: Different eras, roles, backgrounds
2. **Find connections**: How did their lives intersect or parallel?
3. **Represent complexity**: Include figures with contested legacies
4. **Balance perspectives**: Indigenous and settler, reformer and establishment
5. **Cross-reference**: Link biographies to human history and each other

---

## Narrative Weighting Instructions

Apply these criteria to prioritize content with high narrative value:

1. **The Unexpected** `[UNEXPECTED]` — Hidden history, counter-narrative facts
2. **Paradox Resolution** `[PARADOX]` — Character contradictions, moral complexity
3. **The Unusual** `[UNUSUAL]` — Unique achievements, distinctive traits
4. **Human Interest** `[HUMAN]` — Character-revealing anecdotes, emotional stakes
5. **Turning Points** `[TURNING]` — Pivotal decisions, moments of crisis

### Output Format

**Primary Findings** (high narrative weight):
- [Fact with source] `[CRITERION-FLAG]`

**Supporting Context** (essential background):
- [Background fact with source]

Maintain factual accuracy. Narrative interest guides selection, never overrides truthfulness.
