# Human History Query Template

## Purpose

This template provides a structured framework for researching and documenting the complete human history of a region, from prehistoric occupation through the present day.

## How to Use This Template

1. Use each section as a research prompt
2. Apply narrative weighting—history is full of dramatic stories
3. Focus on turning points, overlooked figures, and revisionist discoveries
4. Note sources for all information
5. Organize findings chronologically for human history documentation

## Narrative Weighting Focus

For historical documentation, prioritize:

| Criterion | Look For |
|-----------|----------|
| `[UNEXPECTED]` | Counter-narrative facts, revisionist discoveries, forgotten history |
| `[UNUSUAL]` | Unique historical events, rare occurrences |
| `[TURNING]` | Moments that defined the region's trajectory, near-misses, what-ifs |
| `[HUMAN]` | Individual stories, overlooked figures, personal experiences |
| `[PARADOX]` | Conflicting historical interpretations, moral complexities |

---

## Key Questions to Answer

### Turning Point Questions
- What single event most shaped this region? `[TURNING]`
- What nearly happened that would have changed everything? `[TURNING]`
- What decision by what person altered the course of history?

### Recovery Questions
- Whose stories have been lost or silenced? `[HUMAN]`
- What do we now know that wasn't known before? `[UNEXPECTED]`
- What historical interpretation has been revised? `[PARADOX]`

### Human Questions
- Whose personal story best illustrates the region's history? `[HUMAN]`
- Who deserves to be remembered but isn't? `[HUMAN]`
- What ordinary person had extraordinary impact?

### Legacy Questions

## Example Narrative-Weighted Findings

**High Narrative Weight:**
- "For 80 years, histories credited [Explorer] with 'discovering' the region, ignoring documented evidence that [Indigenous Leader] guided him there deliberately to establish trade relations." `[UNEXPECTED]` `[HUMAN]`
- "If the 1852 treaty had been ratified as written, the entire region would have remained indigenous territory. The single clause that was removed in committee changed everything." `[TURNING]`
- "The 1934 flood killed 200 people and destroyed the town—then the survivors rebuilt it in exactly the same flood-prone location, a decision that still puzzles historians." `[PARADOX]` `[HUMAN]`
- "She is the only person to have held leadership positions in both the colonial government and the independence movement—switching sides after witnessing the massacre of 1898." `[HUMAN]` `[TURNING]`

**Supporting Context:**
- "The first documented European presence was in 1542."
- "The population grew from 500 to 50,000 between 1850 and 1900."

## Output Structure

### Primary Findings (High Narrative Weight)
Turning points, overlooked stories, and dramatic events:
- [Finding] `[FLAG]` - Source

### Supporting Context (Essential Background)
Standard historical data and chronology:
- [Fact with source]

---

## Narrative Weighting Instructions

Apply these criteria to prioritize content with high narrative value:

1. **The Unexpected** `[UNEXPECTED]` — Counter-narrative facts, revisionist discoveries
2. **Paradox Resolution** `[PARADOX]` — Moral complexity, conflicting interpretations
3. **The Unusual** `[UNUSUAL]` — Unique events, rare historical occurrences
4. **Human Interest** `[HUMAN]` — Individual stories, overlooked figures
5. **Turning Points** `[TURNING]` — Defining moments, near-misses, what-ifs

### Output Format

**Primary Findings** (high narrative weight):
- [Fact with source] `[CRITERION-FLAG]`

**Supporting Context** (essential background):
- [Background fact with source]

Maintain factual accuracy. Narrative interest guides selection, never overrides truthfulness.
