# Evolutionary History Query Template

## Purpose

This template provides a structured framework for researching and compiling the deep time evolutionary history of a region, from the Precambrian through the present, including paleoenvironments, fossil record, and evolutionary developments.

---

## Document Structure and Length Guidelines

Evolutionary history documentation uses a **three-document structure** for comprehensive coverage:

| Document | Target Lines | Content Focus |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| `[region]-deep-time.md` | **400-450** | Main comprehensive overview: all eras, endemic lineages, climate history |
| `cenozoic-era.md` | **300-350** | Detailed Cenozoic: mammals, glaciation, ecosystem development |
| `fossil-record.md` | **250-300** | Paleontological focus: sites, discoveries, proxy records |

**Total**: ~950-1,100 lines across three documents

### Document 1: `[region]-deep-time.md` (~400-450 lines)

**Required Sections**:
1. Overview (framing the region's evolutionary story)
2. Narrative Highlights table (5-7 flagged stories)
3. Geological Time Framework table
4. Precambrian section
5. Paleozoic Era section
6. Mesozoic Era section
7. Cenozoic Era section (summary—detailed coverage in doc 2)
8. Endemic Lineages and Living Fossils section
9. Climate History section
10. Cross-References
11. Sources

### Document 2: `cenozoic-era.md` (~300-350 lines)

**Required Sections**:
1. Era Overview table
2. Narrative Highlights table
3. Paleogene Period (Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene)
4. Neogene Period (Miocene, Pliocene)
5. Quaternary Period (Pleistocene, Holocene)
6. Pleistocene Megafauna table
7. Modern Ecosystem Development
8. Cross-References

### Document 3: `fossil-record.md` (~250-300 lines)

**Required Sections**:
1. Overview (frame the "problem" or "richness" of the fossil record)
2. Narrative Highlights table
3. The Region's Fossil Situation (rich/poor and why)
4. Fossil-Bearing Formations (if any)
5. Proxy Records section (for fossil-poor regions)
6. Regional Context (nearby sites that inform the region)
7. Paleontological Research History
8. Living Fossils section
9. Future Research Directions
10. Cross-References

## The "Problem" Framing Approach

For regions with limited fossil records, **frame the absence as the story itself**. This turns a limitation into a narrative hook:

| Rock Type | Problem Name | Narrative Hook |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Granite/Igneous** | "The Granite Problem" | Dinosaurs walked here but granite can't preserve them |
| **Metamorphic** | "The Metamorphic Gap" | Ancient rocks exist but fossils were destroyed |
| **Glaciated** | "The Glacial Erasure" | Ice stripped away the evidence |
| **Heavily Eroded** | "The Erosion Story" | Steep terrain destroys rather than preserves |
| **Young Volcanic** | "The Basalt Barrier" | Recent lava covers older deposits |

**Example Framing** (from Yosemite):
> "Yosemite's evolutionary story presents a profound paradox: dinosaurs certainly walked where Half Dome now stands, yet not a single dinosaur fossil has ever been found in the park `[UNEXPECTED]`. The reason lies in the granite itself..."

---

## How to Use This Template

1. **Assess the region's fossil potential** based on dominant rock types
2. **Choose the appropriate framing** (fossil-rich or "problem" narrative)
3. Use each section as a research prompt
4. Apply narrative weighting—evolution has dramatic stories
5. Focus on mass extinctions, unusual adaptations, and discovery stories
6. Note sources for all information
7. Organize findings by geological era
8. **For fossil-poor regions**: Emphasize proxy records and living fossils

---

## Research Prompt

```
Research and compile the evolutionary history of [REGION-NAME] from deep time to present:

ROCK TYPE ASSESSMENT
First, identify:

- What were environmental conditions?
- Is there evidence of early life?
- What Precambrian formations are present?

PALEOZOIC ERA (538 - 252 MYA)
For each period (Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian):
- What was the paleoenvironment (marine, coastal, terrestrial)?
- What life forms are recorded in fossils?
- What major evolutionary events occurred?
- What formations date to this period?
- How did the Permian mass extinction affect the region?

MESOZOIC ERA (252 - 66 MYA)

- What other organisms (plants, marine life) are recorded?
- What was the paleoenvironment?
- What major evolutionary developments occurred?
- How did the K-Pg extinction affect the region?
- WHY are fossils present or absent from this era? `[PARADOX]`

CENOZOIC ERA (66 MYA - Present)
For each epoch:
- What mammals appeared or evolved?
- How did modern ecosystems develop?
- What were climate conditions?
- When did modern species first appear?
- What glaciation history exists?
- When did humans first arrive? `[TURNING]`

PLEISTOCENE MEGAFAUNA
- What Ice Age animals inhabited or likely inhabited the region?

## Narrative Weighting Focus

For evolutionary documentation, prioritize:

| Criterion | Look For | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `[UNEXPECTED]` | Fossil discoveries that changed understanding; life where none was expected; absence where presence was assumed | "Dinosaurs walked here but left no fossils" |
| `[PARADOX]` | Why fossils are absent; conflicting evidence resolved; how two seemingly contradictory facts are both true | "The oldest rocks are found surrounded by younger granite" |
| `[UNUSUAL]` | Unique species; living fossils; paleoendemic refugia; evolutionary oddities; statistical rarities | "The genus existed 200 million years ago; only 3 species survive" |
| `[TURNING]` | Mass extinctions; glacial cycles; climate catastrophes; human arrival; species extirpation | "The last grizzly bear was killed in 1924" |
| `[HUMAN]` | Discovery stories; paleontologists; researchers; tree-ring scientists | "François Matthes's 1930 study first explained the absence" |

## Example Narrative-Weighted Findings

**High Narrative Weight:**
- "Dinosaurs certainly roamed this region for 180 million years, yet not a single fossil has been found—the granite that creates the spectacular scenery crystallized from magma miles underground, where no fossil could survive." `[UNEXPECTED]` `[PARADOX]`
- "The giant sequoia is a 'living fossil'—its genus existed when dinosaurs walked the Earth, yet only three species survive worldwide, all in isolated refugia." `[UNUSUAL]`
- "Tree rings from the region's ancient trees provide 3,200+ years of continuous climate data—among Earth's longest records." `[UNUSUAL]` `[HUMAN]`
- "When glaciers retreated 10,000 years ago, they left Yosemite Valley filled with a lake—now filled with sediment to create the flat valley floor." `[TURNING]`
- "The Yosemite toad diverged from western toads approximately 2 million years ago, isolated by repeated glacial cycles that created genetic barriers." `[UNUSUAL]`

**Supporting Context:**
- "The region's basement complex dates to 1.7-1.4 billion years ago."
- "Roof pendants—remnants of ancient rock surrounded by granite—are the only pre-batholith rocks in the park."
- "Lake sediment cores provide pollen records extending back 15,000 years."

## Narrative Weighting Instructions

Apply these criteria to prioritize content with high narrative value:

1. **The Unexpected** `[UNEXPECTED]` — Discoveries that changed scientific understanding; absence where presence expected
2. **Paradox Resolution** `[PARADOX]` — How conflicting evidence was reconciled; why fossils are absent
3. **The Unusual** `[UNUSUAL]` — Unique species, rare fossils, evolutionary firsts, living fossils
4. **Human Interest** `[HUMAN]` — Paleontologists, discovery stories, researchers
5. **Turning Points** `[TURNING]` — Mass extinctions, climate catastrophes, evolutionary radiations, human arrival

### Output Format

**Primary Findings** (high narrative weight):
- [Fact with source] `[CRITERION-FLAG]`

**Supporting Context** (essential background):
- [Background fact with source]

Maintain factual accuracy. Narrative interest guides selection, never overrides truthfulness.
