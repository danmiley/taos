# Geographical Analysis Query Template

## Purpose

This template provides a structured framework for researching and compiling comprehensive geographic documentation of a region, covering topography, climate, hydrology, and ecosystems.

## How to Use This Template

1. Use each section as a research prompt
2. Apply narrative weighting to highlight extremes and unusual patterns
3. Seek out record-breaking weather, unique microclimates, and hydrological oddities
4. Note sources for all information
5. Organize findings for geography documentation

---

## Research Prompt

```
Research and compile comprehensive geographic documentation for [REGION-NAME]:

LOCATION AND POSITION
- Precise coordinates (center point and extent)
- Position within larger geographic context
- Relationship to major geographic features
- Administrative boundaries and their history

TOPOGRAPHY
- Elevation range (highest and lowest points with names)
- Major landforms (mountains, valleys, plains, plateaus)
- Terrain characteristics (slope, aspect, relief)
- How topography influences climate and ecosystems
- Notable topographic features and their formation

CLIMATE
- Climate classification (Köppen and other systems)
- Temperature patterns:
  - Annual averages (high, low, mean)
  - Seasonal variation
  - Record extremes (highest, lowest ever recorded)
- Precipitation patterns:
  - Annual totals
  - Seasonal distribution
  - Record extremes (wettest, driest periods)
  - Precipitation types (rain, snow, other)
- Extreme weather:
  - Storm frequency and types
  - Drought history
  - Flood history
  - Other extreme events
- Microclimates:
  - Unusual local climate variations
  - Causes of microclimates
  - Ecological effects

HYDROLOGY
- Major rivers and streams:
  - Names, lengths, flow volumes
  - Sources and mouths

## Narrative Weighting Focus

For geographic documentation, prioritize:

| Criterion | Look For |
|-----------|----------|
| `[UNEXPECTED]` | Climate anomalies, surprising geographic features |
| `[UNUSUAL]` | Record-breaking weather, unique microclimates, rare landforms |
| `[TURNING]` | Floods, droughts, storms that changed the landscape or history |
| `[HUMAN]` | How geography shaped human settlement and activity |
| `[PARADOX]` | Seemingly contradictory geographic features (desert oases, tropical snow) |

---

## Key Questions to Answer

### Extremes Questions
- What are the record temperatures, precipitation events? `[UNUSUAL]`
- What is the most extreme weather event in recorded history? `[TURNING]`
- What geographic superlatives apply (highest, deepest, largest)?

### Uniqueness Questions
- What microclimates exist and why? `[UNEXPECTED]`
- What geographic features are rare or unique? `[UNUSUAL]`
- What paradoxical conditions exist? `[PARADOX]`

### Change Questions
- How has the landscape changed over time? `[TURNING]`
- What rivers have changed course?
- How has climate changed in recorded history?

### Human Interaction Questions
- How has geography shaped human history here? `[HUMAN]`
- What geographic features became barriers or pathways?
- How have humans modified the geography?

## Example Narrative-Weighted Findings

**High Narrative Weight:**
- "Death Valley holds the world record for the highest reliably recorded air temperature: 134°F (56.7°C) on July 10, 1913." `[UNUSUAL]`
- "A single storm in January 1969 dropped 32 inches of rain in 24 hours, triggering floods that reshaped the valley floor." `[TURNING]`
- "Despite annual rainfall of less than 5 inches, the region contains over 1,000 species of plants—more than any desert of comparable size." `[PARADOX]`
- "The microclimate on the mountain's eastern face is so distinct that it supports species found nowhere else within 500 miles." `[UNEXPECTED]`

**Supporting Context:**
- "The region receives an average of 15 inches of precipitation annually."
- "Elevation ranges from 200 feet in the valley to 8,500 feet at the summit."

## Output Structure

### Primary Findings (High Narrative Weight)
Geographic extremes, anomalies, and human-geography stories:
- [Finding] `[FLAG]` - Source

### Supporting Context (Essential Background)
Standard geographic data and measurements:
- [Fact with source]

---

## Narrative Weighting Instructions

Apply these criteria to prioritize content with high narrative value:

1. **The Unexpected** `[UNEXPECTED]` — Geographic features that defy expectations
2. **Paradox Resolution** `[PARADOX]` — How contradictory conditions coexist
3. **The Unusual** `[UNUSUAL]` — Record-breaking events, unique features
4. **Human Interest** `[HUMAN]` — How geography shaped human experience
5. **Turning Points** `[TURNING]` — Catastrophic weather, landscape-changing events

### Output Format

**Primary Findings** (high narrative weight):
- [Fact with source] `[CRITERION-FLAG]`

**Supporting Context** (essential background):
- [Background fact with source]

Maintain factual accuracy. Narrative interest guides selection, never overrides truthfulness.
