# Narrative Research Methodology

## Purpose

This document defines the **narrative-weighted research approach** used throughout this region documentation project. The goal is to produce comprehensive, factually accurate content that is also **lively, engaging, and memorable**—not a dry recounting of facts.

We seek content that makes readers say "I never knew that!" while maintaining rigorous factual standards.

---

## Core Philosophy

> **Narrative interest guides selection and emphasis among verified facts. It never overrides truthfulness.**

Every geographic region contains countless facts. The researcher's job is not merely to collect them, but to apply **editorial judgment** to identify and prioritize content with high narrative value—the stories, paradoxes, and turning points that make a region come alive.

---

## Narrative Weighting Criteria

As you gather information, flag and prioritize content exhibiting one or more of these qualities:

### 1. The Unexpected `[UNEXPECTED]`

Facts that contradict common assumptions or received wisdom about the subject.

**Indicators:**
- Information that would make someone say "I never knew that"
- Details that challenge stereotypes about the region
- Counter-intuitive statistics or outcomes
- Little-known facts that reshape understanding

**Region Examples:**
- A desert region that was once a tropical rainforest
- A remote area that was historically a major trade hub
- A landlocked region with significant maritime history
- A cold climate zone with geothermal hot springs

---

### 2. Paradox Resolution `[PARADOX]`

Details that explain apparent contradictions, reconcile conflicting accounts, or reveal how two seemingly incompatible facts can both be true.

**Indicators:**
- "How can X and Y both be true?"
- Historical debates with surprising resolutions
- Competing narratives that each capture partial truth
- Seeming impossibilities with logical explanations

**Region Examples:**
- How a region can be both geologically young and contain ancient fossils
- Why conflicting cultural origin stories are both historically valid
- How opposing climate patterns coexist in the same area
- Why the same region is claimed by multiple cultural groups

---

### 3. The Unusual `[UNUSUAL]`

Outliers, anomalies, edge cases, or circumstances that deviate significantly from the norm.

**Indicators:**
- Statistical rarities
- One-of-a-kind occurrences
- Unique geological or biological features
- Extreme examples (highest, lowest, oldest, rarest)
- Endemic species or unique ecosystems

**Region Examples:**
- The only place on Earth where a particular mineral forms
- Species found nowhere else on the planet
- Unusual weather phenomena unique to the area
- Rare geological formations or processes
- Record-breaking natural features

---

### 4. Human Interest `[HUMAN]`

Personal stories, individual perspectives, moments of decision, emotional stakes, or details that reveal character, motivation, or the human dimension behind abstract events or data.

**Indicators:**
- Named individuals with compelling stories
- Moments of decision or moral choice
- Emotional stakes and personal sacrifice
- Character-revealing anecdotes
- First-person accounts and oral histories
- The "faces" behind historical events

**Region Examples:**
- The scientist who discovered a crucial fossil and their journey
- Indigenous leaders who shaped the region's identity
- Settlers who faced impossible choices
- Conservationists who saved an endangered species
- Ordinary people caught up in extraordinary regional events

---

### 5. Turning Points `[TURNING]`

Moments where outcomes hung in the balance, near-misses, close calls, or junctures where small changes would have produced dramatically different results.

**Indicators:**
- "What if" moments in regional history
- Narrow escapes from catastrophe
- Decisions that shaped the region's future
- Events that nearly didn't happen
- Alternative histories that almost occurred
- Threshold moments and points of no return

**Region Examples:**
- The volcanic eruption that nearly destroyed a major settlement
- The treaty negotiation that almost failed
- The conservation effort that barely succeeded in time
- The geological event that redirected a river
- The election or policy decision that transformed the region
- Species that nearly went extinct but recovered

---

## Two-Tier Output Structure

All research should produce findings organized in two tiers:

### Tier 1: Primary Findings (High Narrative Weight)

Content meeting one or more narrative criteria above. Each finding should include:
- The fact itself, accurately stated with source
- A criterion flag in brackets: `[UNEXPECTED]`, `[PARADOX]`, `[UNUSUAL]`, `[HUMAN]`, or `[TURNING]`
- Brief note on why it's narratively significant (optional)

**Example:**
> The Yellowstone supervolcano's last major eruption, 640,000 years ago, ejected 240 cubic miles of material—enough to bury the entire state of Texas five feet deep. `[UNUSUAL]` `[TURNING]`

### Tier 2: Supporting Context (Essential Background)

Facts needed to understand the primary findings. These provide:
- Baseline information and definitions
- Geographic and temporal context
- Necessary background for comprehension
- Standard factual framework

**Example:**
> Yellowstone National Park covers 2.2 million acres across Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. It was established in 1872 as the world's first national park.

## Application by Section

### Geology
- **Target narratives:** Catastrophic events, unusual formations, near-miss disasters, discovery stories
- **Ask:** What geological events changed the region dramatically? What formations are unique or surprising?

### Geography
- **Target narratives:** Extreme weather records, unusual microclimates, boundary disputes, geographic paradoxes
- **Ask:** What geographic features defy expectations? What climate extremes define the region?

### Evolutionary History
- **Target narratives:** Mass extinction survivors, unusual adaptations, fossil discoveries, evolutionary mysteries
- **Ask:** What species survived against the odds? What discoveries changed our understanding?

### Flora & Fauna
- **Target narratives:** Endemic species origins, unusual behaviors, conservation turning points, ecological relationships
- **Ask:** What species exist only here and why? What conservation efforts nearly failed or succeeded?

### Cultural Organization
- **Target narratives:** Demographic paradoxes, unexpected political shifts, governance innovations
- **Ask:** What political or social changes surprised observers? What governance approaches are unique?

### Human History
- **Target narratives:** Near-misses, turning points, overlooked figures, revisionist discoveries
- **Ask:** What moments could have gone differently? Whose stories are underrepresented?

### Biographies
- **Target narratives:** Character-revealing moments, unexpected connections, personal paradoxes
- **Ask:** What decisions defined this person? What about them surprises people?

## Quality Standards

### Accuracy First
- Narrative interest never justifies inaccuracy
- All facts must be verifiable from reliable sources
- Distinguish between established facts, scholarly consensus, and speculation
- Note when accounts conflict or evidence is limited

### Balanced Selection
- Don't cherry-pick only dramatic content
- Ensure supporting context provides fair representation
- Avoid sensationalism—let facts speak for themselves
- Include mundane but essential baseline information

### Source Attribution
- Cite sources for all significant claims
- Prefer primary sources where available
- Note when relying on secondary or tertiary sources
- Flag uncertain or disputed information

## Narrative Weighting Instructions

Apply these criteria to prioritize content with high narrative value:

1. **The Unexpected** `[UNEXPECTED]` — Facts that contradict common assumptions
2. **Paradox Resolution** `[PARADOX]` — Details explaining apparent contradictions  
3. **The Unusual** `[UNUSUAL]` — Outliers, anomalies, statistical rarities
4. **Human Interest** `[HUMAN]` — Personal stories and character-revealing details
5. **Turning Points** `[TURNING]` — Moments where outcomes hung in balance

### Output Format

**Primary Findings** (high narrative weight):
- [Fact with source] `[CRITERION-FLAG]`

**Supporting Context** (essential background):
- [Background fact with source]

Maintain factual accuracy. Narrative interest guides selection, never overrides truthfulness.

## Example Application

### Query: Research the geology of [REGION-NAME]

**Primary Findings:**

- The region sits atop a failed rift zone—250 million years ago, Africa nearly split in two here before the rifting process mysteriously stopped. `[UNEXPECTED]` `[TURNING]`

- In 1811-1812, a series of earthquakes here were so powerful they caused the Mississippi River to flow backwards for several hours. `[UNUSUAL]` `[TURNING]`

- Geologist Inge Lehmann discovered evidence at this site that the Earth's core is solid, revolutionizing our understanding of planetary structure. `[HUMAN]` `[UNEXPECTED]`

**Supporting Context:**

- The region's bedrock consists primarily of Precambrian granite overlaid with Paleozoic sedimentary layers.
- Annual seismic activity averages 200 measurable events, though most are too small to feel.
- The primary geological survey was conducted by the USGS between 1965-1972.
