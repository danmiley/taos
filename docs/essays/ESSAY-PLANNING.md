## Writing Directives

*Common to all essays*

### Target Length: 4,000–6,000 Words

Each essay should aim for **4,000–6,000 words**—the length of a substantial magazine feature or long-form essay in *Orion* or *The Atlantic*.

This length enables:
- **McPhee patience** without rushing geological or historical time
- **Solnit spiral** with a real return at the end
- **Consistent voice** maintained throughout
- **The "twist"** properly built toward

Essays under 3,000 words will feel compressed; over 7,000 should be split.

### The Solnit Method
Begin with a specific object, place, or fact, then spiral outward into unexpected connections. Allow digression to become argument.

### McPhee's Patience
Don't rush geological or historical time. Let the reader feel the weight of millennia.

### Core Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Seek the counterintuitive** | The best essay will argue against received wisdom while remaining grounded in evidence |
| **Honor specificity** | Names, dates, species, rock types. The universal emerges from the particular |
| **End with an open door** | Essays should leave readers with a new question, not a closed conclusion |

### Narrative Weighting

Apply project narrative flags where appropriate:
- `[UNEXPECTED]` — Facts contradicting common assumptions
- `[PARADOX]` — Details reconciling conflicting accounts
- `[UNUSUAL]` — Outliers, anomalies, statistical rarities
- `[HUMAN]` — Personal stories, emotional stakes, character details
- `[TURNING]` — Moments where outcomes hung in balance

## Example Essay Types

These examples illustrate the kinds of essays that work well for regional projects. Adapt to your specific region's characteristics.

### Infrastructure Paradox Essay

**Pattern**: A project intended to do X actually accomplished the opposite of X.

**Example prompt structure**: 
"Trace the paradox of [infrastructure project]—how a [era] project designed to '[stated goal]' became, through [mechanism], the instrument of [opposite outcome]. Follow the chain: [step 1] brings [step 2], [step 2] brings [step 3], [step 3] breeds [result]. Consider how [characteristic instability or challenge] functions as a kind of [metaphor] on [larger pattern]."

### Species Biography Essay

**Pattern**: Tell a species' story across multiple timescales to reveal something about the landscape.

**Example prompt structure**:
"Write [species]'s story across three timescales. First, [deep time abundance]—when [historical context]. Then the slow contraction: how [cause] began a [timeframe] squeeze. Finally, the [modern era] crisis and [current state]. The twist: argue that [current population] represents not a 'return to [idealized state]' but something unprecedented—[specific characteristics that make it new]."

### Hermit Sequence Essay

**Pattern**: Map succession of people who chose the region for specific reasons, revealing something about place as thinking technology.

**Example prompt structure**:
"Map the succession of [type of person] who used [region]'s [characteristic] as a [metaphor for function]: [Person A] doing [activity] in the [era], [Person B] arriving [circumstances] in [year] and producing [work], [Person/group C] [activity] in [year]. Argue that [region] functioned as a '[metaphor]' where [pattern] was developed before being transmitted to [elsewhere]."

### Fire/Climate Regime Essay

**Pattern**: Three-era structure showing how a natural process was managed, suppressed, and is now returning in transformed form.

**Example prompt structure**:
"Investigate the lost [regime] of the [indigenous people]—the regular, intentional [activity] that shaped [region]'s [features] for millennia. Then trace the [timeframe] experiment in [suppression] and its consequences. The surprising argument: the '[idealized state]' that conservationists sought to protect was itself a human artifact. What does it mean to preserve something that was never unmanaged?"

### Geological Sibling Essay

**Pattern**: Place region in global conversation with similar landscapes to understand what makes it distinctive.

**Example prompt structure**:
"Place [region] in planetary conversation with its geological siblings: [similar place 1], [similar place 2], [similar place 3]. Investigate what happens when [geological process]—the specific drama of [tectonic/climate context]. But push beyond geology: why did some of these [landscapes] become [one outcome] while [region] remained [different outcome]? What combination of [factor 1], [factor 2], and [factor 3] made [region] distinctive?"

### Atmospheric Phenomenon Essay

**Pattern**: Treat a climate/weather feature as protagonist, tracing its physics, cultural meaning, and uncertain future.

**Example prompt structure**:
"Treat [phenomenon] not as backdrop but as protagonist. Trace the physics—[technical description]. Then explore its cultural work: how [phenomenon] made [region] [quality] to [group], how it [ecological function], how it became [cultural signature]. Consider [phenomenon]'s history—how it [economic/social effects]. End with climate change: [phenomenon] is measurably [changing]. What happens to a landscape defined by [characteristic] when the [characteristic] [changes]?"

### Failure Archive Essay

**Pattern**: Catalog projects that didn't happen to reveal how refusal shaped regional character.

**Example prompt structure**:
"Catalog the projects that didn't happen: the [era] plan to [project 1], the various [type] schemes that collapsed, the proposed [project 2], the [era] [project 3] that would have [transformation]. Argue that [region]'s character was shaped as much by what failed as by what succeeded—that the region is a museum of thwarted ambition. Consider how [economic factor] combined with [social factor] to create a landscape defined by refusal."
