# The Knowledge That Preceded Science

## Ways of Knowing in a Place Known for a Thousand Years

## I. What We Mean When We Say "Knowledge"

Before we begin, we must acknowledge what this essay cannot do.

It cannot speak for Taos Pueblo or any Pueblo community. The knowledge that Pueblo peoples have developed over more than a thousand years belongs to them—not to be summarized by outsiders, not to be extracted for general consumption, not to be reduced to data points in an argument about epistemology. Some of that knowledge is public and has been shared through published sources; much of it is private, restricted, sacred. The boundaries are Pueblo peoples' to draw, and this essay will respect them.

What this essay can do is examine a relationship: the relationship between different ways of knowing, and what happens when they meet.

Western science arrived in the Taos region in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries with instruments, methodologies, and a particular framework for understanding the natural world. It found a landscape that had been understood—deeply, practically, comprehensively—by people who had lived there for centuries. These two knowledge systems, products of different histories and different epistemologies, now coexist. Their coexistence raises questions that are uncomfortable to ask and difficult to answer.

What happens when science "discovers" what was already known? What does it mean to validate indigenous knowledge through Western methods? And what, ultimately, can different ways of knowing teach each other?

## II. The Acequia as Technology

Consider water.

In a high desert valley where precipitation at the valley floor rarely exceeds thirteen inches annually, managing water is not optional. It is the difference between survival and failure. And for centuries before any hydrologist arrived with a rain gauge, Pueblo peoples managed water in this valley.

The acequia system—gravity-fed irrigation channels that divert water from streams to fields—represents a particular kind of knowledge made physical. Though the acequia as a formal system was introduced by Spanish colonizers in the seventeenth century, it built upon water management practices that Pueblo peoples had developed over centuries. `[HUMAN]` The channels themselves may be Spanish in design, but the understanding that water is scarce, seasonal, and must be carefully distributed is indigenous.

An acequia is technology, but it is also knowledge. To build an acequia, you must understand the hydrology of your watershed: where streams flow, when they flow highest, how gravity can be used to move water across the landscape. You must understand soil: where water will infiltrate, where it will run off, what plants it will sustain. You must understand seasonality: when to divert water, how much to divert, when to let streams recover.

This knowledge was developed through observation over generations—watching, testing, adapting. It was not written down in journals or debated in conferences. It was practiced, refined, and transmitted through teaching and example. It was empirical in the deepest sense: derived from experience, tested against reality, corrected when it failed.

Is this science? The question itself may be the wrong question. `[PARADOX]`

## III. Fire Before Suppression

Consider fire.

For most of the twentieth century, American land management operated under a doctrine of fire suppression. Fires were seen as destructive, dangerous, and to be eliminated wherever possible. Firefighters were heroes; fires were villains. The goal was zero fire.

This doctrine was, it turned out, wrong. Decades of fire suppression allowed fuels to accumulate—dense understory vegetation, ladder fuels that could carry fire into the canopy, continuous fuel loads across vast areas. When fires inevitably did occur, they burned with unprecedented intensity, destroying ecosystems that had evolved with frequent, low-intensity fire. The suppression policy, intended to protect forests, had created conditions for their destruction.

What scientists gradually recognized was that fire had historically been part of the landscape—not an intruder but a participant. Frequent, low-intensity fires had cleared understory vegetation, recycled nutrients, created habitat diversity, and maintained the open, park-like conditions that characterized many Western forests. These fires were sometimes ignited by lightning. But they were also ignited by people. `[UNEXPECTED]`

Indigenous peoples throughout the American West, including the Pueblo peoples of New Mexico, are thought to have used fire as a land management tool for centuries. The evidence is scattered—fire scars in old trees, charcoal layers in sediments, ethnographic accounts—but the pattern is consistent: intentional burning to manage vegetation, improve hunting conditions, maintain travel corridors, and support culturally important plant species.

When scientists "discovered" that fire was ecologically necessary and that suppression was counterproductive, they were, in some sense, catching up to knowledge that indigenous peoples had practiced for centuries. `[TURNING]` The science validated the practice, but the practice preceded the science by a very long time.

## IV. What Validation Means

Here the argument must pause and examine itself.

To say that science "validates" indigenous knowledge is to say something important—and something problematic. It is important because it acknowledges that indigenous knowledge systems contain accurate and useful information about the natural world. It is problematic because it implicitly positions Western science as the arbiter of truth, the system that determines what counts as knowledge.

This is a form of epistemological colonialism. Indigenous knowledge, in this framing, becomes real only when science confirms it. Before that confirmation, it is merely belief, tradition, folklore. The validation confers legitimacy—but only because legitimacy was withheld until the validation arrived.

Consider what it means from the other direction. Pueblo peoples did not need hydrologists to tell them how to manage water; they had been doing it successfully for centuries. They did not need fire ecologists to tell them that fire was part of the landscape; they had been burning intentionally since before Europeans arrived. The knowledge was real, effective, and sufficient long before Western science encountered it.

The "discovery" by science of what was already known is not a discovery at all. It is a recognition—a recognition that the framework of Western science had failed to perceive. And the framing of that recognition matters. "Science discovers indigenous people were right" is a headline that still centers science, that still treats indigenous knowledge as an object to be evaluated rather than a system to be respected on its own terms. `[PARADOX]`

## V. Different Ways of Knowing

The relationship between indigenous knowledge and Western science is not one of validation but of difference. These are different knowledge systems, with different origins, different methods, and different purposes. They sometimes arrive at similar conclusions, but they are not the same.

Western science, as it developed in Europe and was exported globally, is characterized by particular features: an emphasis on hypothesis testing, replicability, quantification, and generalizability. It seeks universal laws—principles that apply everywhere and always, regardless of local context. It prizes abstraction, the ability to describe the world in terms that transcend particular places and times.

Indigenous knowledge systems, developed over millennia in particular places by particular peoples, have different emphases. They are typically context-specific, attuned to the particularities of place. They integrate knowledge across domains that Western science separates—ecological knowledge, social knowledge, spiritual knowledge, practical knowledge. They are often transmitted orally, through story and practice rather than text. And they are embedded in relationships—with the land, with community, with ancestors and descendants.

These differences are not hierarchical. They are differences in purpose and method, not differences in validity. A knowledge system developed for universal generalization and a knowledge system developed for local adaptation will look different, will ask different questions, will produce different kinds of understanding. Neither is superior; each is suited to different purposes.

The encounter between these systems in places like Taos is not a conquest of one by the other. It is, or should be, a conversation—an opportunity for each system to learn from the other, to recognize what it does well and what it misses, to become more complete through encounter.

## VI. What Science Misses

Western science, for all its power, has blind spots.

Its emphasis on generalization can miss the particular. A study of fire ecology in ponderosa pine forests may produce generalizations that apply across the Southwest—but miss the specific conditions of a specific drainage in the Sangre de Cristos. Local knowledge, developed through centuries of observation in one place, may be more accurate for that place than generalized studies conducted elsewhere.

Its emphasis on quantification can miss the qualitative. The importance of a spring to a community is not fully captured by measuring its flow rate. The significance of a particular stand of trees is not fully represented by a species list and basal area calculation. Indigenous knowledge systems often encode information about significance—about what matters and why—that scientific frameworks filter out.

Its separation of knowledge domains can miss connections. Western science separates ecology from sociology from spirituality, assigning each to different disciplines with different methodologies. Indigenous knowledge systems often hold these together, recognizing that the health of a watershed is connected to the health of a community, that the treatment of a place reflects and shapes the treatment of people. This integration may be harder to study, but it is not less real.

And its historical association with colonialism shapes what it sees. Western science arrived in New Mexico as part of a colonial project. It was used to map land for expropriation, to classify people for administration, to justify policies that dispossessed indigenous peoples of their territories and practices. This history affects what science studies, who studies it, and whose knowledge counts as legitimate. The relationship between science and indigenous knowledge is not neutral; it is shaped by power.

## VII. What Indigenous Knowledge Shares

It would be equally wrong to romanticize indigenous knowledge as a singular, unchanging, perfect wisdom.

Indigenous knowledge is not monolithic. Different peoples have different knowledge, developed in different places under different conditions. Pueblo knowledge is not the same as Navajo knowledge, which is not the same as Apache knowledge. Even within Pueblo communities, knowledge varies—between elders and young people, between different ceremonial societies, between people with different roles and responsibilities. "Indigenous knowledge" is a category that obscures as much as it reveals.

Indigenous knowledge is not static. It changes, adapts, incorporates new information. Pueblo peoples adopted and adapted Spanish agricultural techniques, just as they had earlier adopted and adapted agricultural techniques from Mesoamerican influences. The knowledge systems that exist today are not unchanged from a thousand years ago; they are living systems that have evolved in response to changing conditions.

And indigenous knowledge is not always available for sharing. Some knowledge is restricted—shared only within particular communities, with particular people, under particular conditions. The boundaries around this restricted knowledge are not arbitrary; they serve social, ceremonial, and protective functions. An essay like this one cannot access that knowledge, cannot evaluate it, cannot comment on it. It can only acknowledge that it exists and that its restriction is legitimate. `[HUMAN]`

## VIII. The Pueblo Revolt and the Preservation of Knowledge

In 1680, Pueblo peoples rose in coordinated revolt against Spanish colonial rule. The uprising, organized in part through religious networks that connected communities across New Mexico, succeeded in driving the Spanish from the region for twelve years. It remains the only successful indigenous uprising against European colonial powers in North American history. `[TURNING]`

Po'pay, a religious leader from San Juan Pueblo (Ohkay Owingeh) with connections to Taos Pueblo, was central to organizing the revolt. The Spanish colonial administration had brutally suppressed traditional Pueblo religious practices, arresting and punishing religious leaders, banning ceremonies, demanding conversion to Catholicism. Po'pay and others organized resistance in secret, using traditional knowledge networks to coordinate an action that required extraordinary secrecy and coordination.

The revolt was about many things: freedom from forced labor, resentment of colonial expropriation, resistance to religious persecution. But it was also about knowledge—about the right of Pueblo peoples to practice their traditions, maintain their ceremonies, transmit their knowledge to future generations. The suppression of traditional religion was, among other things, an attempt to destroy a knowledge system. The revolt was, among other things, an act of preservation.

This history matters for understanding the relationship between indigenous knowledge and Western science. Indigenous knowledge in New Mexico was not passively superseded by Western knowledge. It was actively suppressed, repeatedly, by colonial powers that saw it as a threat. It survived not through neglect but through deliberate preservation, often at great risk. The knowledge that exists today exists because people fought to keep it. `[HUMAN]`

## IX. Contemporary Encounters

Today, in the Taos region and across the Southwest, indigenous knowledge and Western science coexist in various configurations.

Some collaborations are productive. Fire management agencies increasingly consult with tribes about traditional burning practices, incorporating indigenous knowledge into fire management plans. Restoration projects sometimes partner with indigenous communities, recognizing that local knowledge can guide interventions. Research in ethnobotany, ethnoecology, and traditional ecological knowledge seeks to document and respect indigenous perspectives while subjecting them to scientific analysis.

But tensions remain. Collaboration can slide into extraction—indigenous knowledge harvested for scientific papers or management plans without appropriate credit, compensation, or consent. Research protocols designed for Western institutions may not accommodate indigenous protocols about knowledge sharing. Scientists may frame indigenous knowledge as quaint or "spiritual" rather than rigorously empirical.

And some knowledge should not be collaborated upon at all. Sacred knowledge, restricted knowledge, knowledge that is private to particular communities—this knowledge is not material for scientific study. The appropriate response to restricted knowledge is not to try harder to access it, but to respect the restriction. Not everything is available to everyone.

The ongoing encounter between knowledge systems requires ongoing negotiation. There is no final resolution, no permanent protocol. What is appropriate changes with context, with relationships, with the purposes at stake. The encounter is a process, not an outcome.

## X. What the Landscape Knows

Walk the Taos Valley today and you walk through layers of knowledge.

The acequia channels encode centuries of hydrological understanding, water management, community coordination. The piñon-juniper woodlands, their structure shaped by historical fire regimes, record the legacy of indigenous burning and twentieth-century suppression. The agricultural fields, still irrigated by gravity-fed channels, demonstrate practices adapted to high desert conditions over generations. Taos Pueblo's multi-story adobe structures, continuously inhabited for a thousand years, embody architectural knowledge tested against time.

The landscape is a library, but the library is not equally accessible to everyone. Some of its volumes are public, shared through published sources and visitor interpretation. Others are restricted, available only to those who have the right to read them. Understanding the landscape fully—not just its physical features but its meanings—requires respecting these distinctions.

Western science has contributed to understanding this landscape. Geological surveys have mapped its rocks; botanical surveys have catalogued its plants; hydrological studies have measured its water. These contributions are valuable. But they are not the only contributions, and they were not the first.

The knowledge that preceded science is still present, still living, still being practiced and transmitted. It does not need validation from science to be real. It has been real for a very long time.

---

## XI. The Question That Remains

What can different ways of knowing teach each other?

Perhaps they can teach each other humility. Science can learn that its methods, however powerful, do not encompass everything—that there are valid forms of understanding that its frameworks cannot capture. Indigenous knowledge systems can learn from scientific methods where those methods serve local purposes—not as replacements for traditional knowledge, but as supplements that address particular questions.

Perhaps they can teach each other respect. Respect for what each system does well. Respect for the history that has shaped each system. Respect for the people who hold and transmit knowledge, regardless of the system.

And perhaps they can teach each other the limits of teaching. Not every knowledge can or should be shared. Not every encounter is an opportunity for exchange. Some knowledge belongs to particular people in particular places, and the appropriate response is not extraction but recognition—recognition that the knowledge exists, that it is valid, and that it is not ours to take.

The Taos region has been known—deeply, practically, comprehensively—for more than a thousand years. The knowledge that emerged from that long acquaintance is still present, still growing, still adapting to changing conditions. It does not need us to discover it. It needs us to recognize it—and to recognize the difference.
