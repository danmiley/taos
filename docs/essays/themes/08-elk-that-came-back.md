# The Elk That Came Back

## A Restoration Story in Three Acts

## I. The Absence

For most of the twentieth century, there were no elk in the Taos region.

This absence was so complete that it became invisible. Visitors who came to see the mountains, to paint the landscape, to experience what they imagined as pristine wilderness did not notice that the largest deer species in North America—an animal that had shaped this landscape for thousands of years—was missing. The forests stood quiet. The meadows were grazed only by deer and cattle. The autumn nights lacked the sound that had defined this season since before there were humans to hear it.

The bugle of a bull elk is unmistakable—a high, piercing call that begins as a low growl, rises to an almost operatic note, and ends in a series of grunts. It carries for miles through mountain valleys, announcing the rut, challenging rivals, calling to cows. It is the sound of autumn in elk country, as distinctive as geese overhead or frost on the grass.

But in the Taos region, for decades, there was no bugling. The elk were gone.

Understanding how they disappeared—and how they came back—reveals something important about the landscape we inhabit now: a landscape shaped as much by what we removed and restored as by what was always here.

## II. What Was There

For thousands of years, elk were part of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.

The species *Cervus canadensis*—known also as wapiti, from a Shawnee word meaning "white rump"—evolved in North America and colonized essentially all suitable habitat from the tundra edge to the Mexican highlands. They were grazers and browsers, moving seasonally between elevations, following the green-up in spring and the snow in fall. They formed herds, sometimes numbering in the hundreds, that moved across the landscape in patterns governed by food availability, predator pressure, and the imperatives of reproduction.

Elk were, and are, ecosystem shapers. `[UNUSUAL]` Their grazing affects which plants dominate meadows. Their browsing shapes the structure of aspen groves and willow thickets. Their movements create trails that other animals follow. Their bodies, when they die, return nutrients to the soil and feed scavengers from ravens to bears. An ecosystem with elk is not the same as an ecosystem without elk.

For indigenous peoples of the Taos region, elk were a critical resource. `[HUMAN]` The animals provided meat—hundreds of pounds per individual—that could sustain families through lean seasons. They provided hides for clothing and shelter, sinew for cordage, antlers for tools and ornamentation. Traditional hunting practices, developed over generations, reflected deep knowledge of elk behavior: where they moved, when they were vulnerable, how to approach without spooking the herd.

Archaeological evidence shows elk bones at sites throughout the region, confirming their importance to pre-contact peoples. When the Spanish arrived in the sixteenth century, they found elk as part of the functioning ecosystem—a resource already known and used by the people who had lived with them for millennia.

## III. The Destruction

The destruction of elk populations in the American West followed a pattern repeated across the continent: exploitation without limits, followed by collapse.

Spanish colonization did not eliminate elk. The colonial population was too small, the technology too limited, the demand too local to drive the species from the landscape. Elk persisted through the Spanish and Mexican periods, though their numbers likely fluctuated with human hunting pressure and environmental conditions.

The American period was different. `[TURNING]`

After the United States took control of New Mexico in 1848, patterns of land use shifted. Anglo settlers arrived in increasing numbers. Market hunting developed to supply growing towns and, eventually, railroad crews and mining camps. Sport hunting became popular among wealthy easterners who traveled west for trophy animals. And crucially, there were no effective limits on take.

The slaughter was comprehensive. Elk were shot for meat, for hides, for antlers, for sport. Herds that had numbered in the hundreds were reduced to dozens, then to remnants, then to nothing. By the early 1900s, elk had been eliminated from most of their historic range in New Mexico, including the Taos region. The mountains stood empty.

This pattern was not unique to elk or to New Mexico. Across the West, wildlife populations crashed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Bison, which had numbered in the tens of millions, were reduced to a few hundred. Pronghorn, mule deer, and elk all declined precipitously. Market hunting and unregulated sport hunting, combined with habitat loss from overgrazing and settlement, created a crisis that alarmed even some of those who had participated in the destruction.

The conservation movement that emerged in response—championed by figures like Theodore Roosevelt and Aldo Leopold—was a reaction to this collapse. It was, in some sense, a recognition that abundance was not infinite, that the resources of the continent could be exhausted, that limits were necessary if anything was to remain.

## IV. The Decision to Restore

The restoration of elk to New Mexico was a deliberate act of policy—a decision by wildlife managers to reverse what had been done, to return a species to landscapes from which it had been eliminated.

The process began in the early twentieth century, as state game departments, newly empowered with regulatory authority, began to think about restoring depleted wildlife populations. The source animals came from Yellowstone National Park, where a remnant population of elk had survived the nineteenth-century slaughter under federal protection. Yellowstone elk became the seed stock for restoration efforts across the West, including in New Mexico.

The first elk reintroductions in New Mexico occurred in the 1910s and 1920s, with animals transplanted from Yellowstone to various locations in the state. The specific dates and numbers for the Taos region require verification from historical records, but the pattern is well-documented: animals were captured in Yellowstone, shipped by rail, and released into selected habitats where managers hoped they would establish breeding populations.

The early reintroductions were not always successful. Animals died from capture stress, transport difficulties, or failure to adapt to new environments. But over decades, with repeated introductions and natural population growth, elk became re-established across much of their former range in New Mexico. By the mid-twentieth century, elk were again present in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. `[TURNING]`

Today, New Mexico's elk population is measured in the tens of thousands. The species is no longer endangered; it is, by management metrics, thriving. Hunting seasons provide recreation and revenue. Wildlife viewing draws visitors to mountain parks and meadows. The bugle of a bull elk can be heard again in the autumn nights.

---

## V. The Genetics of Restoration

The elk that bugle in the Sangre de Cristos today are not quite the same as the elk that bugled there before the extirpation.

All or nearly all of New Mexico's elk descend from Yellowstone animals—products of a population that survived in a particular place under particular conditions. The elk that were native to New Mexico before the extirpation may have had genetic adaptations to local conditions: adaptations to the specific elevations, vegetation, climate, and disease pressures of the Southern Rockies. Those adaptations, if they existed, were lost when the native populations were eliminated. `[PARADOX]`

This is a subtle but significant point. When we restore a species, we restore it from what remains, which may not be what was there before. The source population carries its own history, its own adaptations, its own genetic quirks. The restored population is continuous with the species as a whole, but it may not be continuous with the specific population that once occupied the restored habitat.

Does this matter? It depends on what you value. If the goal is to have elk in the landscape—to restore ecological function, to provide hunting opportunity, to hear the bugle in autumn—then the source population may be irrelevant. Elk are elk. The Yellowstone animals fill the niche, play the role, perform the function.

But if the goal is to preserve the full diversity of the species—the local adaptations, the genetic variants, the population-level differences that evolution produced over thousands of years—then something has been lost that cannot be recovered. The pre-extirpation elk of New Mexico are gone forever, their genetic distinctiveness erased. What remains is a reconstruction, a restoration, a simulacrum of what was—but not quite the thing itself.

This is the paradox of restoration: it can return a species to a landscape, but it cannot undo extinction. What was lost is lost. What we restore is something new. `[PARADOX]`

## VI. What Restoration Changes

The return of elk to the Taos landscape has consequences that ripple through the ecosystem.

Elk are large herbivores—bulls can weigh 1,000 pounds or more—and their appetites shape vegetation communities. Where elk graze intensively, grasses and forbs are kept short, and the plant species that tolerate grazing prosper while those that do not decline. Where elk browse intensively, aspen regeneration can be suppressed, willow thickets thinned, and forest understory opened. The effects depend on elk density, grazing duration, and the condition of the vegetation before elk arrived.

Some of these effects are positive from a conservation perspective. Elk grazing can increase plant diversity in meadows by preventing competitive dominance by a few grass species. Elk trails create openings in vegetation that benefit other species. Elk carcasses feed scavengers and return nutrients to the soil.

Other effects are more complex. Heavy elk browsing can suppress aspen regeneration, preventing the recruitment of young trees that would eventually replace aging stands. In some areas, elk have been implicated in the decline of riparian vegetation, their browsing on willows reducing habitat for beaver and songbirds. These effects are analogous to those attributed to elk in Yellowstone, where the removal and restoration of wolves has provided natural experiments in the effects of ungulate grazing.

Elk also interact with human land uses. They compete with cattle for forage on public lands leased for grazing. They move onto private lands to feed on irrigated crops. They pose hazards on roadways, particularly in autumn when the rut drives movements and reduces wariness. Managing elk requires managing these conflicts—balancing population goals against agricultural impacts, public safety, and landowner tolerance.

## VII. The Disease Question

Any discussion of elk restoration must now contend with chronic wasting disease.

CWD is a fatal neurological disease of deer and elk, caused by misfolded proteins called prions. It spreads through direct contact between animals and through environmental contamination; once prions are established in an area, they can persist in soil for years, creating long-term infection risk. Infected animals develop progressive neurological deterioration, wasting, and death. There is no cure, no vaccine, and no known way to eliminate the disease once it is established.

CWD has been detected in New Mexico, including in areas not far from Taos. The disease threatens to undo some of the conservation gains that elk restoration has achieved. If CWD becomes widespread, elk populations may decline significantly. The ecological and cultural benefits of elk presence may be compromised. The hunting economy that elk support may contract.

Wildlife managers are struggling to respond. Options are limited: CWD cannot be eradicated, only managed. Strategies focus on reducing density to slow transmission, monitoring to detect spread, and removing infected animals where possible. But prions are remarkably persistent, and the disease is remarkably transmissible. The long-term trajectory is uncertain.

CWD is a reminder that restoration does not create a stable endpoint. `[TURNING]` It creates a population that is subject to the same threats as any wild population: disease, habitat change, climate shifts, human impacts. The elk that came back can, in principle, be lost again. There is no guarantee.

## VIII. What We Chose Not to Restore

The elk restoration raises a question that is rarely asked: Why elk and not bison?

Bison were part of the Taos landscape historically. Archaeological evidence confirms their presence, and historical accounts describe bison on the plains east of the mountains and occasionally within the mountain parks themselves. Like elk, bison were eliminated by nineteenth-century hunting. Unlike elk, they were not restored.

The reasons are partly practical. Bison are larger than elk, more difficult to handle, more dangerous to transport and release. They require larger ranges and are more challenging to contain on a landscape fragmented by roads, fences, and private property. Bison also carry brucellosis, a bacterial disease transmissible to cattle, which makes ranchers and agricultural agencies hostile to their restoration on public lands.

But the reasons are also cultural and economic. Elk are compatible with the existing system of wildlife management in ways that bison are not. Elk hunting generates significant revenue for state wildlife agencies and local economies. Elk coexist, if sometimes uneasily, with cattle grazing on public lands. Elk do not challenge the fundamental organization of the landscape in the way that bison would. `[UNEXPECTED]`

To restore bison would require rethinking how land is used, who controls it, and what outcomes we prioritize. It would require confronting the agricultural interests that have shaped public land policy since the nineteenth century. It would require accepting that some places should look and function differently than they do now.

This is not an argument for or against bison restoration. It is an observation that the choice to restore elk—and not other species—was a choice, shaped by the possibilities and constraints of a particular moment. We restored what we could restore within the existing system, not necessarily what was most ecologically important or culturally significant. The restored landscape is not the pre-contact landscape; it is a curated selection of elements we chose to bring back.

## IX. Living with the Restored

Today, elk are a taken-for-granted part of the Taos landscape. Visitors expect to see them. Hunters pursue them. Wildlife watchers photograph them. They appear on postcards and tourism websites, emblems of wild New Mexico.

This familiarity obscures the history. Most people who encounter elk in the Sangre de Cristos do not know that they are encountering a restored population—animals descended from Yellowstone stock, transplanted to a landscape from which their ancestors were extirpated less than a century ago. They do not know that for decades, there were no elk here at all. They see the animals as natural, as if they had always been present, as if the landscape we inhabit now is the landscape that has always been.

There is value in this forgetting. A restored population that is treated as natural, as belonging, may be more valued and better protected than one that is constantly reminded of its artificiality. The elk belong to the Sangre de Cristos now, whatever their origins, and the sense of belonging may be what sustains them.

But there is also danger in forgetting. If we do not remember what was lost, we may not understand what we have. If we do not remember the destruction, we may not understand the fragility. If we do not remember the restoration, we may not understand that what exists now was a choice—and that different choices could have been made, could still be made, could still change what this landscape becomes.

The elk that came back are a gift and a responsibility. They are evidence that we can undo some of the damage we have done, that extirpation need not be permanent, that the patience and persistence of restoration can succeed. They are also a reminder that we are not finished—that the landscape we inhabit is not a final state but an ongoing project, shaped by choices we continue to make.

## X. The Open Question

Stand in a mountain meadow at dawn in September and wait.

The fog is rising from the valley. The aspens on the ridge are beginning to turn. The grass is tall and wet with dew. Somewhere in the timber, a bull elk is stirring, his breath visible in the cold air, his antlers catching the first light.

And then he bugles.

The sound rises, wild and strange, a sound that has no human equivalent, a sound that connects you to every autumn morning in these mountains for the past ten thousand years—and to every autumn morning from which that sound was absent, the decades when the meadows were silent, when the elk were gone.

What does it mean to restore a species to a landscape?

It means that we have the power to destroy, and sometimes the wisdom to rebuild. It means that the choices we make—the limits we accept, the values we prioritize, the future we imagine—shape the world in which we and other species live. It means that the landscape we inhabit is not given but made, not permanent but contingent, not inevitable but chosen.

The elk that came back are an invitation to think about what else we might restore, what else we might protect, what kind of landscape we want to inhabit. They are a question as much as an answer: If we brought the elk back, what else is possible?

The bull steps into the meadow, massive and magnificent, his breath steaming in the cold. He tips his head back and bugles again, the sound echoing off the peaks.

He does not know that his kind was once absent from this place. He does not know the history that brought him here. He knows only what elk have always known: that the autumn is coming, that the rut is upon him, that the mountains are his home.

For now, that is enough. The question of what comes next belongs to us.
