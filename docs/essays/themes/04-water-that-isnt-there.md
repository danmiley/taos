# The Water That Isn't There

## A Paradox of Abundance and Scarcity

> "Water is life's matter and matrix, mother and medium. There is no life without water."

## I. The Paradox

Look up at Wheeler Peak on a spring morning and you see abundance. Snow covers the upper slopes, reflecting sunlight so intensely it hurts the eyes. The snowpack extends down to 10,000 feet, perhaps lower—a vast reservoir of frozen water accumulated through the winter months. At its peak, this snowpack may contain the equivalent of 40 or more inches of precipitation, locked in ice crystals waiting for the sun's warmth to release them.

Now look around the Taos Valley floor. The sagebrush is brown. The soil is cracked. The acequia that runs through the field is nearly dry, its banks crusted with mineral deposits left by evaporating water. A cottonwood tree stands leafless at midsummer, stressed beyond its capacity to transpire. The well on the property next door has been lowered twice in the past decade, chasing a water table that keeps dropping.

How can a place be water-rich in the mountains and water-poor in the valley, when the valley is only eight miles from the peaks?

This is the paradox of water in Taos—a paradox that has shaped human settlement for more than a thousand years and that is intensifying as climate changes and populations grow. `[PARADOX]` The water is there, but it is not accessible. The water is there, but it is already claimed. The water is there, but it flows away before it can be used.

Understanding this paradox requires understanding the physics of water in steep terrain, the history of water law in the American West, and the cultural systems that have developed to manage scarcity. All of these converge in the Taos Valley, creating a landscape where water is simultaneously everywhere and nowhere.

## II. The Physics of Shedding

The Sangre de Cristo Mountains receive abundant precipitation—40 or more inches annually at the highest elevations, primarily as winter snow. This is more than three times what the valley floor receives. By any measure, the mountains are well-watered.

But the mountains are also steep. The terrain rises from the valley floor at 7,000 feet to Wheeler Peak at 13,161 feet in a horizontal distance of less than ten miles. This creates slopes averaging 600 feet of vertical rise per mile—grades so steep that gravity dominates the water cycle.

When the snowpack melts in spring, the water does not linger. It runs off. Steep slopes accelerate runoff; there is little time for water to infiltrate the soil before gravity carries it downhill. The mountain streams swell with snowmelt in May and June, running high and cold, but this pulse of water lasts only weeks. By July, the streams have dropped to baseflow, sustained only by whatever groundwater seeps into the channels.

The valley floor has limited capacity to capture this pulse. The alluvial aquifer—the underground water storage in the sediments of the valley—is thin and discontinuous. The volcanic rocks that underlie much of the plateau have limited porosity. There are no large natural lakes to store runoff. The water that melts in the mountains flows through the valley and continues downhill, toward the Rio Grande, toward Texas, toward the Gulf of Mexico. `[UNEXPECTED]`

This is the first layer of the paradox: the water falls on the mountains, but it passes through the valley rather than remaining in it. Proximity to abundance does not guarantee access.

## III. The Law of Prior Appropriation

The second layer of the paradox is legal.

New Mexico, like most Western states, operates under the doctrine of prior appropriation—a water law system summarized as "first in time, first in right." Under this doctrine, water rights are not attached to land ownership. Instead, they are separate property rights, allocated to the first user who diverted water from a stream or aquifer for beneficial use. Later users can only claim water that remains after prior users have taken their share.

This system made a certain kind of sense in the nineteenth century, when the West was being settled and water was seen as a resource to be exploited for economic development. It encouraged irrigation agriculture by guaranteeing that those who invested in water infrastructure would be able to use the water they diverted. It created a predictable system of allocation that could be adjudicated when disputes arose.

But the system also created a structural problem: water rights can be—and have been—allocated in excess of the actual water supply. When water was abundant and users were few, this over-allocation was invisible. But as the West filled up and climate began to shift, the over-allocation became apparent. More water has been legally promised than exists in the rivers and aquifers.

In the Taos area, this over-allocation is acute. `[TURNING]` The Rio Grande and its tributaries are "fully appropriated" or "over-appropriated"—meaning that all available water has been legally allocated, and in some years, there is not enough water to satisfy all water rights. Senior rights holders—those with the oldest claims—receive their water first. Junior rights holders may receive nothing.

This creates a peculiar legal geography. A farmer with a water right dating to 1880 may receive full water deliveries even in a drought year. A neighbor with a water right dating to 1920 may receive partial deliveries. A third neighbor with a water right from 1960 may receive nothing. All three farm the same land, under the same sky, with the same river flowing past—but their legal access to water differs dramatically.

## IV. The Acequia System

The paradox of water scarcity in a land of mountain abundance is not new. The Pueblo peoples who have lived in the Taos area for more than a thousand years understood that water was precious and developed systems for managing it. When Spanish colonizers arrived in the seventeenth century, they brought with them the acequia—a gravity-fed irrigation system with roots in North Africa and Moorish Spain.

The acequia is a canal, dug by hand or by community labor, that diverts water from a stream and carries it to fields through a network of secondary channels. The system requires no pumps, no electricity, no fuel—only gravity, labor, and cooperation. Water enters the acequia at a diversion point upstream and flows downhill through the main canal to distribution points where it is directed to individual fields.

But the acequia is more than infrastructure. It is a social institution. Each acequia is governed by a commission of parciantes—the water-right holders who receive water from that acequia. The commission elects a mayordomo, a water master, who is responsible for managing the acequia: maintaining the channels, allocating water among users, resolving disputes, and ensuring that the system functions through the irrigation season. `[HUMAN]`

The mayordomo's role is both practical and diplomatic. In a dry year, when water is insufficient for all users, the mayordomo must make decisions about who receives water and when. These decisions are guided by custom, by the priority dates of water rights, and by community norms—but they are also judgment calls, made by an individual who will face the consequences of their decisions in daily interactions with neighbors. The mayordomo is a water manager, a mediator, and a community leader, all in one.

The acequia system assumes scarcity. It was designed not for abundance but for shortage—a mechanism for sharing a limited resource among multiple users who all need it and cannot all have as much as they want. The system's genius is its recognition that water management is a social problem as much as a technical one. The physical infrastructure is relatively simple; the social infrastructure—the rules, the customs, the institutions—is what makes it work.

## V. The Taos Pueblo Water Rights Settlement

For the Pueblo peoples, water has meanings that transcend the legal categories of prior appropriation. Water is sacred. Springs and rivers hold spiritual significance. The relationship with water is not one of ownership but of reciprocity—the water sustains the people, and the people have responsibilities toward the water.

This understanding did not fit easily into the American legal system. When the United States took control of New Mexico in 1848, following the Mexican-American War, it inherited a complex landscape of existing water claims—Spanish colonial grants, Mexican-era allocations, and indigenous rights that predated all European claims. The new American territorial government attempted to impose prior appropriation on this landscape, but the fit was imperfect.

The result was decades of legal uncertainty. Taos Pueblo's water rights, like those of other pueblos, were recognized in principle but never quantified. How much water did the Pueblo have a right to use? From which sources? With what priority date? These questions remained unanswered, creating conflict and uncertainty that affected everyone in the watershed.

In 2010, a settlement was reached. `[TURNING]` The Taos Pueblo Water Rights Settlement quantified the Pueblo's water rights, established a priority date predating all other users in the area (reflecting the Pueblo's more than thousand-year occupation), and allocated funds for water infrastructure. The settlement also created mechanisms for the Pueblo to lease water to other users, providing a framework for cooperation rather than conflict.

The settlement did not resolve all tensions. Water remains scarce, and climate change is making it scarcer. But the settlement represented a recognition—rare in the history of federal-tribal relations—that indigenous water rights are real and substantial, and that the prior appropriation system must accommodate them. `[HUMAN]`

## VI. Groundwater: The Invisible Crisis

Surface water—the rivers and streams that flow through the valley—is the most visible part of the water system. But for many residents of the Taos area, groundwater is more important. They depend on wells for domestic water, and those wells draw from aquifers beneath the valley floor.

Groundwater is the water that isn't there in a different sense: you cannot see it, cannot directly observe its level, cannot easily know how much remains. Aquifers are underground, accessible only through wells and monitored only through occasional measurements. The invisible nature of groundwater makes it easy to overuse—the consequences of pumping too much become apparent only when wells go dry.

In the Taos area, groundwater levels have been declining. `[TURNING]` The causes are multiple: pumping for domestic use and irrigation, reduced recharge during drought years, and the cumulative effect of decades of withdrawal exceeding replenishment. Wells that once struck water at fifty feet now require drilling to a hundred feet or more. Some wells have gone dry entirely.

The relationship between surface water and groundwater complicates management. When farmers pump groundwater for irrigation, they may be capturing water that would otherwise have flowed into streams—reducing surface water available to downstream users with legal water rights. When the Rio Grande flows low, groundwater recharge diminishes, and wells draw down more quickly. Surface and subsurface are connected in ways that legal systems, designed for simpler times, struggle to address.

New Mexico's water law is slowly adapting. The Office of the State Engineer has authority over both surface water and groundwater, and increasingly enforces requirements that groundwater pumping not impair surface water rights. But the enforcement mechanisms are slow, the monitoring is incomplete, and the politics are contentious. Groundwater remains the invisible frontier of water conflict.

## VII. Climate Change and the Intensifying Paradox

The paradox of water in Taos is intensifying.

Climate models project that the Southwest will become hotter and, on average, drier in coming decades. Even if precipitation totals remain roughly stable—and some models project decline—the higher temperatures will increase evaporative demand. The same amount of water will accomplish less. Snowpack will decline as more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow, and as snow melts earlier in the season. The timing of water availability will shift, with implications for irrigation, ecosystems, and fire.

The monsoon may become more variable. Some years will bring abundant summer rain; others will bring drought. The reliability of the seasonal pattern—the assumption that July will bring clouds and August will bring rain—may erode. In a system already stressed, increased variability adds another layer of uncertainty.

What does climate change mean for the paradox of water that isn't there?

It means that the water falling on the mountains will be less effectively captured as snowpack and more quickly lost to runoff and evaporation. The stored water—the snow that accumulates through winter and melts through spring—will diminish. The timing of water delivery will shift earlier, out of sync with growing seasons. The margin of error in water management will shrink.

It also means that the conflicts embedded in the current water system will intensify. When water was relatively abundant, over-allocation was a paper problem—all users received enough, regardless of their legal priority. As water becomes scarcer, the reality of over-allocation will become apparent. Senior water rights will cut off junior rights. The legal battles will multiply.

## VIII. The Culture of Scarcity

Living with water scarcity creates a culture. In Taos, that culture has deep roots.

The acequia system is a cultural artifact as much as an engineering one. It reflects values: cooperation over competition, community over individual, tradition over innovation. The annual acequia cleaning—when parciantes gather to clear their canal of debris before the irrigation season—is a community event, an opportunity to reinforce social bonds as much as to maintain infrastructure. The mayordomo is a respected community figure, chosen for judgment and fairness as much as for technical skill.

The Pueblo's relationship with water embeds spiritual dimensions that prior appropriation cannot capture. Water is not merely a resource to be allocated; it is a relative, a source of life, a sacred element. The springs that feed the Rio Pueblo de Taos are protected not only by law but by religious practice.

Even among Anglo settlers who arrived more recently, the culture of scarcity shapes behavior. Water conservation is not a choice but a necessity. Landscaping with xeric plants is practical, not aesthetic. The knowledge that your well might go dry if you water too much concentrates the mind.

This culture of scarcity may prove adaptive in the coming century. Communities that have never experienced water shortage will struggle to adjust when it arrives. Communities that have managed scarcity for centuries have institutional memory, established practices, and cultural norms that can guide adaptation. The acequia system, in particular, offers lessons for water management that the rest of the West might learn from—lessons about cooperation, about flexibility, about accepting that water is limited and must be shared.

## IX. What the Paradox Teaches

The paradox of water in Taos—abundant mountain precipitation coexisting with chronic valley scarcity—is not a problem to be solved. It is a condition to be managed.

The physical reality is that steep terrain sheds water quickly, that storage capacity is limited, and that demand exceeds supply. No technology can change these facts. Dams could store more water, but the geology is unfavorable and the environmental consequences significant. Desalination is irrelevant when the nearest ocean is 400 miles away. Conservation can reduce demand, but in a region already practicing conservation, the remaining savings are marginal.

The legal reality is that water rights were allocated in a different era, under different assumptions, and that untangling them is a multi-generational project. The Taos Pueblo settlement took decades to negotiate. Similar settlements for other water systems remain incomplete. The over-appropriation built into the system cannot be quickly undone.

The cultural reality is that water in Taos is not merely a commodity but a value—something that communities organize around, that institutions are built upon, that defines identity. Any approach to water management that treats it as a purely technical or economic problem will fail. Water in Taos is political, spiritual, historical, and personal.

What the paradox teaches is that living with water scarcity requires humility. It requires accepting that the water you need is not always the water you get. It requires cooperating with neighbors, because individual solutions are insufficient. It requires respecting the priority of those who came before, while also recognizing that the past does not determine the future. It requires living within limits—a concept that the wider American culture has not yet fully internalized.

## X. The Open Question

The Rio Grande flows through Taos, its modest volume belying its name. The Great River is not so great here—reduced by upstream diversions, depleted by drought, over-appropriated by law. And yet it flows. It has flowed for millions of years, since before there were humans to divert it, since before there was law to allocate it. It will flow—in some form, in some amount—long after the current disputes are forgotten.

The question is whether the people who live along its banks can adapt to the water that is actually there, rather than the water they wish were there.

The Pueblo peoples managed for more than a thousand years, developing practices suited to a variable and limited water supply. The acequia communities managed for centuries, creating institutions that assumed scarcity and built cooperation into their structure. Can the modern communities that have inherited this landscape—the towns, the suburbs, the ski resorts, the second homes—develop the same discipline?

Climate change is narrowing the margin for error. The water that isn't there is becoming less there. The snow is melting earlier. The aquifers are dropping. The legal system is struggling to allocate what remains. The old patterns are breaking down.

What emerges from this breakdown is uncertain. Perhaps new institutions will arise, better suited to an era of intensifying scarcity. Perhaps existing institutions—the acequias, the Pueblo, the community land grants—will prove more resilient than anyone expected. Perhaps conflict will escalate as users compete for a shrinking resource. Perhaps some combination of all three.

What is certain is that the water defines the place. Taos is what it is because of the water that falls on the mountains and the water that doesn't reach the valley. The paradox is not a puzzle to solve but a condition to inhabit. Living in Taos means living with the water that isn't there.
