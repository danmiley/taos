# The Monsoon That Defines the Desert

## I. The Wait

By late June, the Taos Valley has been drying for months.

The last significant precipitation fell as snow in March or April, melting into the soil or running off to join the mountain streams. Since then, the sun has risen earlier each day, climbing higher in the sky, baking the sagebrush steppe until the very air seems to crackle. Afternoon temperatures reach into the eighties and nineties. Humidity drops to single digits—10 percent, 8 percent, sometimes lower. The wind blows hot and dry off the plateau, carrying dust and the smell of sage.

This is fire season. The piñon-juniper woodlands are tinder. The grasses have cured to yellow. A single spark—from lightning, from a campfire, from a dragging chain—can ignite an inferno. Forest Service crews watch the horizon, waiting for smoke. Ranchers move cattle to water sources that still flow. Farmers ration what's left in their acequias. Everyone watches the sky.

And then, usually in early July, the pattern shifts.

The first sign is the clouds. After months of empty blue, cumulus clouds begin building over the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in the afternoon. They are tentative at first—small white puffs that evaporate by evening. But within days, they grow larger, darker, more confident. Thunderheads tower over Wheeler Peak, anvil-shaped and flickering with internal lightning.

By mid-July, the storms arrive. They form over the mountains in the afternoon, move down into the valley by evening, and unleash rain—sometimes gentle, sometimes violent, always welcome. The smell of wet sage fills the air. Arroyos that have been dry for months suddenly run with brown water. The temperature drops twenty degrees in minutes. The monsoon has arrived. `[TURNING]`

## II. The Physics of the Pattern

The North American Monsoon is not a storm or even a series of storms. It is a seasonal restructuring of atmospheric circulation—a continental-scale pattern that redirects moisture from the tropics into the interior Southwest.

The physics begins with heating. As spring progresses into summer, the desert Southwest absorbs enormous quantities of solar radiation. The land surface heats rapidly, and the air above it rises. This rising air creates an area of low pressure—a thermal low—centered over the desert Southwest. Low pressure draws air toward it from surrounding areas.

In winter and spring, the air that flows into the Southwest comes primarily from the west and northwest, carrying Pacific moisture that gets wrung out over California and the Sierra Nevada. By the time this air reaches New Mexico, it is dry. The Southwest is a rain shadow.

But as the thermal low deepens in summer, the circulation pattern changes. Air begins to flow from the south and southeast, drawing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of California. This tropical moisture pushes northward, riding southerly winds into Arizona, New Mexico, and beyond. When this moist air encounters the mountains of the Southwest, it is forced upward. Rising air cools, condenses, and precipitates. The monsoon begins. `[UNUSUAL]`

The daily cycle becomes predictable. Mornings are clear—the overnight cooling has allowed the atmosphere to stabilize. As the sun heats the ground, convection begins. By afternoon, clouds are building over the mountains. By late afternoon or evening, thunderstorms form, often over the highest terrain first, then moving down into valleys as the storms mature and propagate. Rain falls, sometimes in torrents. Lightning flashes. Then, as evening arrives, the storms weaken, the sky clears, and the cycle is ready to repeat.

This pattern persists from early July through September, tapering off as the days shorten and the thermal low weakens. During these three months, Taos receives 40 to 50 percent of its annual precipitation—five to seven inches of rain in a region that receives only twelve to thirteen inches per year at the valley floor. `[TURNING]`

## III. What the Monsoon Provides

To call the monsoon important understates its significance. The monsoon is the difference between marginal habitability and genuine desert.

Consider the arithmetic. The Taos Valley floor receives approximately twelve to thirteen inches of precipitation annually. Of that, perhaps five to six inches falls during winter and spring, primarily as snow. This winter moisture recharges soil moisture and supports early-season growth, but by June, it has largely evaporated or been consumed by plants. The remaining six to seven inches falls during the monsoon season—precisely when temperatures are highest, evaporation is most intense, and biological water demand is greatest.

Without the monsoon, the Taos Valley would receive only five to six inches of precipitation annually—roughly the same as the Mojave Desert. `[UNEXPECTED]` The sagebrush steppe that characterizes the valley floor would likely give way to more xeric vegetation. Agriculture, even with irrigation, would be more precarious. The streams that flow from the mountains would provide some water, but the summer would be far more hostile.

The monsoon's timing is as important as its quantity. The rains arrive when plants are most stressed, when fire danger is highest, when livestock need water and pasture is depleted. The monsoon interrupts the drying trend of late spring and early summer, resetting the ecosystem for the fall transition. Without this intervention, the June-to-October period would be a continuous desiccation.

The monsoon also recharges aquifers. While most monsoon rain runs off quickly in the steep terrain, some infiltrates into the soil and percolates downward. This recharge is critical for maintaining groundwater levels, particularly in areas where wells provide domestic and agricultural water. In drought years, when the monsoon fails or arrives weak, aquifers decline and wells go dry.

## IV. The Fire Connection

Lightning and rain are born from the same storms. This creates a complex relationship between the monsoon and fire that has shaped the Taos landscape for millennia.

Before the monsoon arrives—in the pre-monsoon period of May and June—the landscape is primed for fire. Fuels are dry, humidity is low, and conditions favor fire spread. But there is little lightning. Fires that ignite are typically human-caused.

When the monsoon begins, lightning becomes abundant. Thunderstorms that form over the mountains generate thousands of cloud-to-ground lightning strikes during the season. These strikes frequently ignite fires, particularly in the piñon-juniper and ponderosa pine zones where dry fuels are abundant.

But the same storms that bring lightning also bring rain. Monsoon thunderstorms typically drop significant precipitation on or near fires they ignite, limiting fire spread. This natural feedback—ignition followed by suppression—results in a fire regime characterized by frequent, small fires rather than infrequent, large ones. `[PARADOX]`

Or at least, that was the historical pattern. Indigenous peoples of the Taos region, including the Taos Pueblo, are thought to have practiced intentional burning for centuries, using fire to manage vegetation, improve hunting conditions, and maintain the landscape. When these intentional fires are combined with lightning-ignited fires—both of which were typically kept small by monsoon rains—the result was a mosaic of burned and unburned patches that increased ecological diversity and reduced fuel accumulation.

Modern fire suppression has disrupted this pattern. By extinguishing fires quickly, land managers prevented the regular, small fires that historically consumed fuels before they could accumulate. The result has been fuel buildup—dense stands of trees and shrubs that now support much larger, more intense fires than occurred historically. When monsoon rains fail to suppress these fires, or when fires escape before the monsoon arrives, the consequences can be catastrophic.

The monsoon remains a critical fire-limiting factor. In years when the monsoon arrives early and strong, fire season ends quickly. In years when the monsoon is late or weak, fires can burn through July and into August, consuming acres that would normally have been protected by rain.

## V. Variability and Vulnerability

The monsoon is not reliable. Its arrival date varies by weeks from year to year. Its intensity fluctuates from robust to nearly absent. Its duration can be cut short by early-season atmospheric changes. This variability is the monsoon's second defining characteristic, after its existence.

Some summers, the monsoon begins in late June and persists strongly through September, delivering above-average precipitation across three months. The landscape greens, fires are suppressed, streams run higher, and the summer feels almost humid by Southwest standards.

Other summers, the monsoon sputters. The moisture arrives late—mid-July instead of late June. The storms are scattered and brief, dropping rain on one valley while the next valley remains dry. The precipitation totals fall below average, sometimes well below. The fire season extends. Drought stress persists.

The worst years are those when the monsoon essentially fails. The atmospheric circulation pattern shifts, the moisture stays to the south, and the Southwest receives only scattered thunderstorms rather than the sustained pattern that defines a true monsoon. These failure years are rare but devastating. The 2000-2003 drought, for example, included multiple weak monsoon seasons that compounded water stress and set the stage for widespread tree mortality and severe fire seasons.

Climate scientists are working to understand what controls this variability. Sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of California and Gulf of Mexico play a role, as does the position of high-pressure systems over the Southwest. El Niño and La Niña patterns influence monsoon strength, though the relationships are complex and not always predictive. What is clear is that the monsoon's variability creates boom-and-bust cycles in water availability, with consequences that ripple through ecosystems and human communities.

## VI. The Drought Years

Stand in Taos during a drought summer and the landscape tells the story.

The 2000-2003 drought was one of the most severe in recent memory. Winter precipitation was below normal. Spring arrived dry. The monsoon season brought only scattered rain. Across the Taos region, trees began to die—piñon pines stressed by drought became vulnerable to bark beetles, and millions of trees turned brown and fell. The forest composition changed in ways that will persist for decades.

The 2011-2012 drought brought similar conditions. Water tables declined. Wells went dry in some areas. Acequia flows diminished, and farmers faced water shortages. Fire danger remained extreme into late summer. The landscape browned and cracked.

These drought episodes reveal the monsoon's importance through its absence. `[TURNING]` When the summer rains fail, the consequences cascade through every system. Vegetation dies. Fire risk escalates. Water supplies dwindle. Wildlife concentrates around the few remaining water sources. The economy suffers as farmers, ranchers, and tourism operators all feel the effects.

The pattern is not new. Tree-ring records from the Taos region show that droughts have occurred periodically for centuries, sometimes lasting a decade or more. The late thirteenth-century drought that contributed to the abandonment of ancestral Pueblo sites in the Four Corners region also affected the Taos area. Droughts in the mid-1800s and early 1900s are recorded in the rings of old trees. The monsoon has always been variable, and drought has always been a feature of the Southwest.

What is changing is the context. Climate warming is increasing evaporative demand—even if precipitation stays the same, the warmer atmosphere pulls more water from soils and plants. Snowpack is declining, and snowmelt is occurring earlier. The seasonal pulse of water that sustains the region is shifting in timing and magnitude. The monsoon may become more intense in peak events but less reliable in total delivery. The old patterns are becoming less predictable.

## VII. The Human Rhythm

For the Pueblo peoples who have lived in the Taos region for more than a thousand years, the monsoon is not a meteorological abstraction. It is the rhythm around which life is organized.

Traditional agriculture in the Taos Valley was synchronized with water availability. `[HUMAN]` Winter snows filled the mountains. Spring snowmelt fed the acequias—gravity-fed irrigation channels that distributed water to fields. Planting occurred in spring, timed to take advantage of snowmelt irrigation. Then the dry period arrived, and crops depended on whatever water remained in the acequias and on the arrival of the monsoon.

The monsoon's rains supported late-summer crops and replenished soil moisture for fall. The timing of harvest was influenced by monsoon patterns—too much rain could damage crops; too little could stress them. Reading the weather, predicting rain, understanding cloud patterns—these were practical skills, not academic exercises. Knowledge of the monsoon was knowledge necessary for survival.

This traditional ecological knowledge developed over centuries of observation. It included understanding which valleys received more rain, which slopes caught the first storms, which arroyos would flood and when. This knowledge was passed through generations, refined by experience, and encoded in practice. `[HUMAN]`

The acequia system, brought by Spanish colonizers but adapted from indigenous practices, formalized the distribution of water. Acequia associations, led by mayordomos, managed the channels and allocated water according to established rules. The system was designed for scarcity—it assumed that water would be insufficient and created mechanisms for sharing the shortage. The monsoon's variability was built into the system's assumptions.

Modern life in Taos remains tied to the monsoon, though the connections are less visible. Farmers still watch the clouds. Firefighters breathe easier when the rains come. Restaurants on the plaza close their patios when afternoon storms roll in. The rhythm persists, even if the explicit knowledge has faded.

## VIII. The Artists and the Light

Taos became an art colony at least partly because of its weather, and the monsoon is central to that weather.

When Ernest Blumenschein and Bert Phillips arrived in Taos in 1898—the origin story of the Taos Society of Artists—they encountered a landscape with exceptional qualities of light. The high elevation (around 7,000 feet) meant thinner atmosphere and more intense sun. The clear, dry air meant sharp contrasts between light and shadow. The mountains provided dramatic backdrops that changed character with the angle of the sun.

But the monsoon season offered something else: cloud drama. The summer skies of Taos are not empty. They are theatrical—cumulus towers building over the mountains, anvil heads spreading across the horizon, rain curtains falling in distant curtains while the viewer stands in sunshine. The play of light and shadow across the valley floor, the rainbows that appear after storms, the sunsets intensified by moisture in the atmosphere—these are monsoon gifts.

Georgia O'Keeffe, who spent time in the Taos area in the 1920s and 1930s (though she is more closely associated with Abiquiú to the south), painted skies that captured the region's atmospheric drama. D.H. Lawrence, living at Kiowa Ranch north of Taos in the 1920s, wrote about New Mexico's landscape with attention to weather and light. Whether these artists consciously understood the monsoon as a meteorological pattern is unclear, but they responded to its aesthetic effects. The dramatic skies of July and August, the shifting light, the sense of a landscape animated by weather—these were the conditions the monsoon created.

The art colony's appeal was not only visual. The monsoon brought relief from heat, a sense of seasonal rhythm, a reminder that the desert was not static but responsive to larger forces. The "feel" of a Taos summer—the morning clarity, the afternoon buildup, the evening storms, the night cooling—is a monsoon phenomenon. Remove the monsoon, and the summer becomes simply hot and dry.

## IX. What Climate Change Means

The monsoon is changing. The question is how.

Climate models offer conflicting projections for the North American Monsoon. Some suggest that the monsoon will intensify—that a warmer atmosphere will hold more moisture, and that when monsoon conditions develop, storms will be more intense. Others suggest that the monsoon will become less reliable—that shifts in atmospheric circulation will disrupt the seasonal pattern, leading to more years when the monsoon fails or arrives late.

What seems increasingly likely is greater variability. The old patterns—the mid-July onset, the predictable afternoon storms, the gradual taper in September—may become less consistent. Some years will bring exceptional monsoon seasons with abundant rain. Others will bring disappointing seasons that barely qualify. The uncertainty itself will increase. `[TURNING]`

For a region already at the edge of aridity, this increased variability poses serious challenges. Water management systems designed for one pattern of precipitation must adapt to another. Fire management must account for shifting fire seasons. Agriculture must cope with uncertain water supplies. Ecosystems that have adapted to a certain rhythm may struggle when that rhythm changes.

The warming trend also affects the monsoon's effectiveness. Even if precipitation totals remain the same, warmer temperatures increase evaporation. Rain that falls in a 90-degree afternoon evaporates more quickly than rain that falls in an 80-degree afternoon. The same precipitation buys less water in a warmer world. The monsoon may continue to arrive, but its capacity to sustain the landscape may diminish.

---

## X. The Question That Remains

The monsoon will arrive this summer, as it has arrived for tens of thousands of summers before. The clouds will build over the mountains, the storms will form, the rain will fall. For a few months, the Taos Valley will remember what it means to have water.

But the pattern is fragile—more fragile than it appears. The monsoon is not a guarantee; it is a probability, a tendency, a pattern that can strengthen or weaken according to forces operating thousands of miles away. A shift in Pacific sea surface temperatures, a change in the position of the jet stream, a long-term warming trend—any of these can alter the monsoon in ways that reshape the landscape.

What does it mean to live in a place defined by a weather pattern that is itself changing?

The Taos Valley has been occupied continuously for more than a thousand years because the monsoon made occupation possible. It has supported agriculture, maintained ecosystems, and limited fire because the summer rains arrived, year after year, with enough regularity to sustain life. The monsoon is not the background to Taos's story; it is the foundation.

As the climate changes, that foundation is shifting. The monsoon that defines the desert may be redefining itself. Whether it remains strong enough to sustain the landscape—and the communities that depend on it—is the question this century will answer.

The clouds are building over the Sangre de Cristos. The afternoon is growing humid. Somewhere to the east, lightning flickers. The monsoon is coming.

Or perhaps, this year, it is not.
