## Biography Summary

### Early Life

Christopher "Kit" Carson was born December 24, 1809, in Madison County, Kentucky. His family moved to Missouri when he was young, and at age 15, he left home to join a trading caravan to Santa Fe, marking the beginning of his extensive travels and adventures in the American West. He worked as a trapper, guide, and scout, developing deep knowledge of western territories and indigenous languages and cultures.

### Career/Public Life

Carson gained national fame as a guide for John C. Frémont's expeditions in the 1840s, which mapped vast areas of the western territories.

In 1854, he was appointed as an Indian agent in Taos, New Mexico, where he managed relations with the Ute and Jicarilla Apache tribes. During the American Civil War, Carson led the 1st New Mexico Volunteer Cavalry for the Union, participating in campaigns against Confederate forces and various Native American tribes, including the controversial forced removal of Navajos.
