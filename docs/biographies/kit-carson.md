### Primary Contribution 2: Indian Agent in Taos

#### Managing Relations with Native American Tribes (1854-1861)

His work managing relations with the Ute and Jicarilla Apache tribes involved mediating conflicts and working to assist Native American communities, reflecting a different aspect of his relationship with indigenous peoples than his later military campaigns.

The paradox of Carson's work as Indian agent reflects broader tensions in his legacy. `[PARADOX]` As an Indian agent, he worked to mediate conflicts and assist Native American communities, yet during military campaigns, he participated in forced removals.
