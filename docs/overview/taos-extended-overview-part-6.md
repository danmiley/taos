# Taos, New Mexico - Extended Overview (Part 6 of 10)

## XIV. Wildlife Overview

### Elevation-Driven Diversity

Taos's dramatic elevation range supports exceptional wildlife diversity, with species adapted to environments ranging from high desert valleys to alpine tundra. The compressed life zones enable wildlife to move seasonally between elevations, while the region's relative isolation has allowed some species to develop unique adaptations. `[UNUSUAL]` The convergence of desert, montane, and alpine ecosystems creates habitat for species typically found in widely separated regions.

**Wildlife Diversity Summary**:
- **Mammals**: Diverse assemblage from desert-adapted species to alpine specialists
- **Birds**: Mix of resident and migratory species, including high-elevation specialists
- **Reptiles and Amphibians**: Limited but notable species adapted to high-elevation conditions
- **Fish**: Native cold-water species in mountain streams; introduced species in some waters
- **Invertebrates**: Diverse insect fauna, including pollinators and alpine specialists

### Mammals

**Large Mammals**:

The Taos region supports several large mammal species, though historical extinctions have reduced diversity:

- **Elk** (*Cervus canadensis*) - Large ungulates, reintroduced and now thriving in montane forests `[TURNING]`
- **Mule deer** (*Odocoileus hemionus*) - Common throughout, from valley to forest zones
- **Pronghorn** (*Antilocapra americana*) - Open grassland and sagebrush specialists, found in valley areas
- **Bighorn sheep** (*Ovis canadensis*) - Rocky mountain specialists, historically present, conservation status varies
- **Black bear** (*Ursus americanus*) - Forest-dwelling omnivores, present in montane zones
- **Mountain lion** (*Puma concolor*) - Apex predator, present but rarely seen `[UNUSUAL]`

**Historical Losses**: `[TURNING]`
- **Grizzly bear** - Extirpated by early 1900s, last recorded kill in New Mexico mountains
- **Gray wolf** - Extirpated, though occasional dispersers from northern populations may pass through
- **Bison** - Historically present on plains, extirpated from region

**Medium and Small Mammals**:

- **Coyote** (*Canis latrans*) - Highly adaptable canid, common throughout
- **Red fox** (*Vulpes vulpes*) - Present in forested areas
- **Bobcat** (*Lynx rufus*) - Forest-dwelling predator
- **Porcupine** (*Erethizon dorsatum*) - Forest specialist, notable for quills
- **Beaver** (*Castor canadensis*) - Riparian engineer, present along streams `[HUMAN]` - historically important for fur trade
- **Pika** (*Ochotona princeps*) - Alpine specialist, found above treeline `[UNUSUAL]`
- **Various rodents** - Squirrels, chipmunks, mice, voles adapted to different elevations
- **Bats** - Multiple species, important insectivores

### Birds

**Raptors**:

- **Golden eagle** (*Aquila chrysaetos*) - Large raptor, nests on cliffs, hunts across elevations
- **Bald eagle** (*Haliaeetus leucocephalus*) - Present along rivers, especially during winter
- **Red-tailed hawk** (*Buteo jamaicensis*) - Common throughout, most frequently seen raptor
- **Peregrine falcon** (*Falco peregrinus*) - Cliff-nesting specialist, recovery success story `[TURNING]`
- **Northern goshawk** (*Accipiter gentilis*) - Forest-dwelling predator

**Songbirds and Other Birds**:

- **Steller's jay** (*Cyanocitta stelleri*) - Montane forest corvid, intelligent and vocal
- **Clark's nutcracker** (*Nucifraga columbiana*) - High-elevation specialist, important seed disperser for conifers `[UNUSUAL]`
- **Mountain bluebird** (*Sialia currucoides*) - Open country specialist, state bird of Idaho and Nevada
- **Various warblers** - Migratory species passing through during spring and fall
- **Hummingbirds** - Multiple species, important pollinators, attracted to high-elevation flowers
- **Woodpeckers** - Multiple species including downy, hairy, and three-toed woodpeckers

**Game Birds**:

- **Wild turkey** (*Meleagris gallopavo*) - Reintroduced, now common in forests `[TURNING]`
- **Blue grouse** (*Dendragapus obscurus*) - High-elevation forest specialist
- **Various quail** - Scaled quail and Gambel's quail in lower elevations

**Waterfowl**:

- **Mallard** (*Anas platyrhynchos*) - Common along rivers and ponds
- **Canada goose** (*Branta canadensis*) - Present along waterways
- **Various ducks** - Seasonal migrants and residents

### Reptiles and Amphibians

**Reptiles**:

The high elevation and cold winters limit reptile diversity compared to lower-elevation desert regions:

- **Gopher snake** (*Pituophis catenifer*) - Common non-venomous snake
- **Prairie rattlesnake** (*Crotalus viridis*) - Venomous snake, present but less common at high elevations
- **Various lizards** - Including fence lizards and other small species
- **Limited diversity**: Cold winters and high elevation restrict reptile populations

**Amphibians**:

- **Boreal chorus frog** (*Pseudacris maculata*) - Small frog, breeds in temporary pools
- **Tiger salamander** (*Ambystoma tigrinum*) - Present in suitable aquatic habitats
- **Limited diversity**: Arid conditions and high elevation limit amphibian populations

### Fish

**Native Species**:

- **Rio Grande cutthroat trout** (*Oncorhynchus clarkii virginalis*) - Native trout subspecies, conservation priority `[TURNING]` `[UNUSUAL]`
- **Rio Grande sucker** (*Catostomus plebeius*) - Native sucker species
- **Various minnows** - Native small fish species

**Introduced Species**:

- **Rainbow trout** (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*) - Widely introduced for sport fishing
- **Brown trout** (*Salmo trutta*) - Introduced, now common in many streams
- **Brook trout** (*Salvelinus fontinalis*) - Introduced to high-elevation streams

**Conservation Challenges**: Native fish face threats from introduced species, habitat alteration, and water diversions. Rio Grande cutthroat trout is a conservation priority with ongoing recovery efforts.

### Invertebrates

**Insects**:

- **Pollinators** - Diverse bee, butterfly, and moth species supporting plant reproduction
- **Alpine specialists** - Cold-adapted insects surviving in harsh high-elevation conditions
- **Aquatic insects** - Important food source for fish and other aquatic life
- **Grasshoppers and crickets** - Abundant in grasslands and meadows

**Other Invertebrates**:

- **Spiders** - Diverse arachnid fauna
- **Scorpions** - Present in lower elevations, adapted to desert conditions
