# Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout
*Oncorhynchus clarkii virginalis*

## Biographical Lead Quote

> "We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect."
> — **Aldo Leopold**, *A Sand County Almanac* (1949)

*Note: Rio Grande cutthroat trout exemplify land as community—native fish that have evolved unique adaptations to southwestern streams, representing the interconnected relationships between water, fish, and ecosystems that Leopold's land ethic recognizes.*
