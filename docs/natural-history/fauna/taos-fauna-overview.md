## Introduction

Taos, New Mexico's fauna reflects the region's dramatic elevation gradient—nearly 7,000 feet from valley floor to Wheeler Peak's summit at 13,161 feet. This extreme vertical range creates exceptional wildlife diversity, with species adapted to environments ranging from high desert valleys to alpine tundra. `[UNUSUAL]` The compressed life zones enable wildlife to move seasonally between elevations, while the region's relative isolation has allowed some species to develop unique adaptations.

The region's wildlife tells stories of adaptation, persistence, and human connection. `[HUMAN]` Indigenous peoples have maintained deep relationships with regional wildlife for millennia, with traditional knowledge of animal behavior, ecology, and sustainable use practices. `[TURNING]` Historical extinctions—including grizzly bear, gray wolf, and bison—altered ecosystem dynamics, while successful reintroductions of elk and wild turkey represent conservation victories. The native Rio Grande cutthroat trout faces ongoing conservation challenges, while high-elevation specialists like pika demonstrate remarkable adaptations to extreme conditions.

| Academic researchers | 1900s-present | Ecological studies and conservation research |

### Major Studies and Surveys

Wildlife surveys have documented regional fauna, with ongoing research on species distributions, ecological relationships, and responses to environmental change. Forest Service and academic researchers have conducted systematic inventories of wildlife communities.

### Ongoing Research

Current research focuses on:
- Climate change impacts on wildlife
- Species reintroductions and recovery
- Human-wildlife interactions
- Conservation of threatened species

## Climate Change Impacts `[TURNING]`

### Observed Changes

High-elevation species are already experiencing impacts from climate change, with warming temperatures affecting species distributions, phenology, and habitat availability. `[TURNING]` Alpine communities face particular challenges as suitable habitat shrinks.

### Vulnerable Species

High-elevation specialists, including pika, Clark's nutcracker, and alpine-adapted species, are most vulnerable to climate change. `[TURNING]` These species have limited options for upward migration as temperatures warm, potentially facing local extinctions.

### Range Shifts

Climate models project continued warming, which will likely:
- Affect species distributions along elevation gradients
- Alter migration patterns and timing
- Impact high-elevation species most severely
- Create new challenges for conservation
