# Beaver
*Castor canadensis*

## Biographical Lead Quote

> "We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect."
> — **Aldo Leopold**, *A Sand County Almanac* (1949)

*Note: Beavers exemplify land as community—ecosystem engineers that transform landscapes through dam-building, creating wetlands that support diverse life and demonstrating the interconnected relationships between animals, water, and ecosystems that Leopold's land ethic recognizes.*
