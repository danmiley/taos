# Elk
*Cervus canadensis*

## Biographical Lead Quote

> "We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect."
> — **Aldo Leopold**, *A Sand County Almanac* (1949)

*Note: Elk's successful reintroduction exemplifies land as community—restoring a native species that shapes ecosystems through grazing and browsing, demonstrating the interconnected relationships between wildlife, vegetation, and ecosystem health that Leopold's land ethic recognizes.*
