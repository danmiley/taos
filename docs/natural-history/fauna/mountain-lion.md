# Mountain Lion
*Puma concolor*

## Biographical Lead Quote

> "The landscape here is unlike anything else. The light, the colors, the forms—everything is different, more intense."
> — **Georgia O'Keeffe**, on New Mexico landscape (1929)

*Note: Mountain lions exemplify the intense, wild character of the landscape—apex predators that move silently through montane forests, rarely seen but always present, representing the untamed wilderness that drew O'Keeffe to New Mexico.*

## Description

### Physical Characteristics
- **Body Length**: 5-9 feet (nose to tail; tail 2-3 feet)
- **Weight**: 80-200 pounds (males larger than females; typically 100-150 pounds)
- **Height**: 2-2.5 feet at shoulder
- **Sexual Dimorphism**: Males larger than females
- **Lifespan**: 8-13 years (wild); up to 20+ years in captivity

### Identifying Features
- **Coloration**: **Uniform tan to gray-brown**—distinctive uniform coloration (no spots or stripes in adults) `[UNUSUAL]`
- **Markings**: Uniform coloration; black tip on tail; white underside
- **Distinctive Features**: **Large size**; long tail; uniform coloration; powerful build
- **Vocalizations**: Rarely vocal; can produce screams, growls, and other sounds

### Distinguishing Characteristics `[UNUSUAL]`

Mountain lions are identified by:
- **Uniform coloration** - No spots or stripes (unlike many other cats) `[UNUSUAL]`
- **Large size** - One of largest cats in Americas
- **Long tail** - Long, thick tail (2-3 feet)
- **Powerful build** - Muscular, powerful body
- **Elusive behavior** - Rarely seen despite presence `[UNUSUAL]`

The combination of uniform coloration, large size, and elusive behavior makes mountain lions distinctive. `[UNUSUAL]` Their uniform tan coloration distinguishes them from other large cats, while their elusive nature means most encounters are indirect (tracks, scat, kills).

- **How It Reached Taos, New Mexico**: Native to region; historically present

### Endemic Status `[UNUSUAL]`

While not endemic, mountain lions represent important apex predators. `[UNUSUAL]` Their wide geographic range (largest of any wild cat in Americas) and role as apex predators make them ecologically significant.

### Fossil Record

Fossil evidence indicates mountain lions have been present in North America for millions of years. `[HUMAN]` Historical records show mountain lions were more widespread historically, with persecution reducing populations in many areas.

### Unique Adaptations `[UNUSUAL]`

Mountain lions have evolved adaptations for predation:

- **Powerful build** - Enables taking large prey
- **Stalking ability** - Specialized hunting behavior
- **Elusive nature** - Avoids detection
- **Wide range** - Adaptable to various habitats

## Observation

### Where to See

**Best Locations**:
- **Montane forests** - Various elevations
- **Rocky areas** - Canyons and rocky terrain

**Access**: Rarely seen; most encounters are indirect (tracks, scat, kills). Best opportunities in remote areas with good habitat.

### When to See

**Best Seasons**:
- **Year-round** - Present year-round but rarely seen
- **Winter** - May be more visible due to snow and tracks

**Best Times**: Dawn and dusk (crepuscular activity); night (nocturnal activity). Most sightings are accidental and brief.

### Behavior to Watch For

- **Tracks** - Large, round tracks (most common sign)
- **Scat** - Large scat with hair and bone
- **Kills** - Cached kills covered with debris
- **Rare sightings** - Brief, often at distance

### Photography Notes

- **Challenges**: **Extremely difficult**—rarely seen; most photography is of tracks and sign
- **Equipment**: Long lenses essential if sighted
- **Ethics**: Maintain distance; respect wildlife
- **Indirect Photography**: Tracks, scat, and habitat photography more realistic

### Safety Considerations

- **Rare Attacks**: Attacks on humans extremely rare but possible
- **Distance**: Maintain distance if encountered
- **Behavior**: Do not approach; back away slowly
- **Children**: Extra caution with children
