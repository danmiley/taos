### Fossil Record

Fossil evidence indicates sagebrush has been present in western North America for millions of years. The species' adaptations to semi-arid conditions reflect long evolutionary history.

### Unique Adaptations `[UNUSUAL]`

Big sagebrush has evolved remarkable adaptations for semi-arid environments:

- **Drought Tolerance**: Deep root systems and water-conserving leaves
- **Silvery Hairs**: Fine hairs reduce water loss and reflect sunlight
- **Aromatic Compounds**: Chemical defenses against herbivores and pathogens
- **Fire Adaptation**: Ability to resprout after fire
- **Allelopathy**: Chemical compounds may inhibit competing plants

`[UNEXPECTED]` These adaptations allow big sagebrush to dominate harsh environments where many other plants cannot survive, creating distinctive plant communities.
