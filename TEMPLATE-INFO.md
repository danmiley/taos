## Key Features

### Narrative Research Methodology

This template emphasizes **narrative-weighted research** to produce engaging content. All research applies five key criteria:

| Criterion | Description | Flag |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **The Unexpected** | Facts contradicting common assumptions | `[UNEXPECTED]` |
| **Paradox Resolution** | Details reconciling conflicting accounts | `[PARADOX]` |
| **The Unusual** | Outliers, anomalies, statistical rarities | `[UNUSUAL]` |
| **Human Interest** | Personal stories, emotional stakes | `[HUMAN]` |
| **Turning Points** | Moments where outcomes hung in balance | `[TURNING]` |

See `queries/narrative-research-methodology.md` for complete documentation.

### Two-Tier Output Structure

All research produces:
- **Primary Findings**: High narrative-weight content with criterion flags
- **Supporting Context**: Essential background for comprehension
